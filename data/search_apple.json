On Friday I wrote that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/microsoft-apple\">Microsoft is the new Apple<\/a>, and it seems like China's tech community may be thinking the same thing.\n\nApple's upgraded MacBook Pro line obviously made headlines across all of China's tech news sites, but commenters seem decidedly underwhelmed by Apple's innovations this go-round. For example, one popular comment <a href=\"http:\/\/comment5.news.sina.com.cn\/comment\/skin\/default.html?channel=kj&newsid=comos-fxxfuff6995630\">on Sina Tech<\/a> reads:\n\n<blockquote>Apple's launch events are getting more and more disappointing. Originally I was thinking I'd wait for the upgraded MacBook Pro, but it turns out all they \"upgraded\" was the price. It's just not worth it. Can Apple get back to the transformative way it was in the Steve Jobs era? Now it seems its attempts at change are very stiff. Like the ports. In the Jobs era, everybody was excited by the changes Apple made. If you just keep slowly chewing through your capital, it's just a matter of time before Chinese machines surpass you guys [at Apple].<\/blockquote>\n\nBut if Chinese machines are on the verge of surpassing Apple, it seems for some commenters Microsoft's machines already have. One of the most popular comments on Sina Tech reads: \"Compared to the Surface Book, this is totally unattractive.\" And over on Netease Tech, when one commenter listed some upsides of the new MacBook Pro, another commenter replied: \"I think those upsides you mentioned are all even better on the Surface.\" That reply received five times as many upvotes as the MacBook-praising comment it was responding to.\n\n\"With the pricing so similar, I choose the Surface,\" wrote another commenter.\n\nOf course, there were also numerous comments across all of China's tech sites praising Apple's newest machines, but the overall mood was decidedly negative. In a Sina Tech poll asking users whether they wanted to buy the new MacBook Pro, only 14.3 percent (as of this writing) said yes. 49.3 percent said they wouldn't buy it, and the other 36.3 percent were undecided.\n\nIt would be foolish to draw any hard conclusions based on such a limited sample of customer sentiment, but the mood of China's tech site commenters also shouldn't be ignored. After all, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/china-thinks-iphone-7\">commenters were also pretty negative<\/a> after Apple's iPhone 7 launch, and a month later, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/10\/20\/demand-for-apples-iphone-7-in-china-is-tepid-ubs-says.html\">analysts were saying China had only \"tepid\" interest<\/a> in the new phone. If the same proves true for these new MacBooks, Apple could be in for yet another quarter of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/business\/tech\/2016-10\/27\/content_27185568.htm\">scary drops in its China market<\/a>. And after Microsoft's impressive event last week, it looks likely that Apple loss could end up being Microsoft's gain.",

The acquisition happened in June, <em>Bloomberg<\/em> said.\n\nTuplejump was founded by Rohit Rai, Satyaprakash Buddhavarapu, and Deepak Alur. According to Rohit and Satyaprakash\u2019s LinkedIn profiles, they moved to work at Apple in May. Deepak left to join <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anaplan.com\">Anaplan<\/a> in April. Tuplejump\u2019s site has been taken down.\n\n\u201cApple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,\u201d Colin Johnson, an Apple spokesman, said in a statement to <em>TechCrunch<\/em>.\n\nIf the reports are true, this will be Apple\u2019s third acquisition this year. Last month, it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2016\/exclusive-apple-acquires-turi-major-exit-seattle-based-machine-learning-ai-startup\/\">bought<\/a> machine-learning startup Turi for US$200 million.

             "image":"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iphone-black-750x434.jpg",
             "content":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iphone-black-750x434.jpg\" alt=\"iphone-black\" width=\"750\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-352382\" \/>\n\nWhen Apple's new iPhone 7 phones went on sale last week, they went on sale with a new color: jet black. In its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sbios0u2Px8\">launch video<\/a>, Apple laid the marketing on pretty thick; designer Jony Ive says the black is the result of a \"whole new process\" that produces \"the most singular, most evolved\" iPhone ever.\n\nWith all due respect to Mr. Ive, I disagree. Apple's jet black iPhone isn't singular. It's derivative, it's user-unfriendly, and it's a pretty transparent cash-grab.\n\n<h2>This isn't even new!<\/h2>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/original-iphone-750x400.jpg\" alt=\"original-iphone\" width=\"750\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-352370\" \/>\n\nFirst of all, does no one remember that <del datetime=\"2016-09-19T02:23:09+00:00\">early iPhones, including <em>the first iPhone ever<\/em>,<\/del> the iPhone 3G came with a glossy black finish? I'm not sure whether or not those phones went through \"rotational 3D polishing\" with a \"specialized compound\"  or \"a magentized ultra-fine ion particle bath\" like Ive gushed about with the iPhone 7. But the end result is pretty much the same. It's a shiny black iPhone.\n\nRemind me again why I'm supposed to be drooling over a color I had on an iPhone back in 2008?\n\n<h2>Fingerprint magnet<\/h2>\n\nOf course, there is a good reason glossy black hasn't been available on iPhones since the early days. That glossy mirror-black that looks so great in promotional photos looks pretty terrible in real life when the phone's being handled by a human. The shiny finish collects smudges and fingerprints, and the black color helps them stand out. The end result is that after a few days of real use, the old gloss-black iPhones generally had back covers that looked like they'd been worked over by a sticky-fingered toddler.\n\nAnd despite all of the complex jargon Ive used to describe the iPhone 7's \"new\" jet black finish, it shares the exact same problem as older black gloss finishes. Don't take my word for it; here's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/09\/fingerprints-look-much-worse-jet-black-iphone-7\/\"><em>Wired<\/em><\/a> on the new jet black phones:\n\n<blockquote> Most of [jet black iPhone 7 buyers] will admire their super shiny phone exactly once, because, as reviewers have noted, that lust-worthy luster turns into a serious smudgefest within minutes. Like, way worse than the not-jet-black black. Turns out, the same properties that make for superior sheen also attract fingerprints faster than a season of CSI: Miami.<\/blockquote>\n\nWhoops.\n\nAnd of course, glossy finishes tend to show scrapes and scratches more conspicuously too.\n\n<h2>Xiaomi-style sales tactics<\/h2>\n\nSo, you've got a not-really-new color that actually looks <em>worse<\/em> than any other iPhone color as soon as people put their hands on the phone. How do you sell that? You hype the crap out of it and then tell people supplies are limited.\n\n\n\nIn Apple's defense, as a business tactic this works well. It certainly worked for Xiaomi in the early days. And given that jet black phones are mostly sold out across the globe, it's obviously working for Apple, too. It's not very consumer-friendly, though, because it encourages phone-scalping. And at least in China (Apple's biggest market) it seems like things are already getting out of hand; Chinese media has reported <a href=\"http:\/\/tech.sina.com.cn\/mobile\/n\/n\/2016-09-16\/doc-ifxvyqvy6502165.shtml\">scalpers charging as much as US$3,000 for jet black iPhones<\/a>, having bought up all the supply themselves.\n\nApple could have prevented this. Given that the phone's physical design is so similar to previous versions, it's very difficult to believe that time or technical limitations could have prevented Apple from producing more jet black phones if it had wanted to. And Apple certainly could (and should) have guessed that scalpers would be all over the jet black models given how much Apple hyped them during the launch event. But of course, Apple didn't <em>want<\/em> to prevent this, because news of the jet black phones being sold out is great marketing that makes the new phones seem desirable and more likely to sell better in the long run.\n\nWe can't blame Apple too much for trying to make money. But that doesn't mean we need to buy into this cheap trick. Buy whatever phone you want, but don't be fooled by the hype of jet black. And whatever you do, don't pay scalper prices for a phone that (I'd be willing to bet) will be available on a broad scale at list price within a few months.",

In its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sbios0u2Px8\">launch video<\/a>, <em>Apple<\/em> laid the marketing on pretty thick; designer Jony Ive says the black is the result of a \"whole new process\" that produces \"the most singular, most evolved\" iPhone ever.\n\nWith all due respect to Mr. Ive, I disagree. <em>Apple<\/em>'s jet black iPhone isn't singular. It's derivative, it's user-unfriendly, and it's a pretty transparent cash-grab.\n\n<h2>This isn't even new!<\/h2>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/original-iphone-750x400.jpg\" alt=\"original-iphone\" width=\"750\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-352370\" \/>\n\nFirst of all, does no one remember that <del datetime=\"2016-09-19T02:23:09+00:00\">early iPhones, including <em>the first iPhone ever<\/em>,<\/del> the iPhone 3G came with a glossy black finish? I'm not sure whether or not those phones went through \"rotational 3D polishing\" with a \"specialized compound\"  or \"a magentized ultra-fine ion particle bath\" like Ive gushed about with the iPhone 7. But the end result is pretty much the same. It's a shiny black iPhone.\n\nRemind me again why I'm supposed to be drooling over a color I had on an iPhone back in 2008?\n\n<h2>Fingerprint magnet<\/h2>\n\nOf course, there is a good reason glossy black hasn't been available on iPhones since the early days. That glossy mirror-black that looks so great in promotional photos looks pretty terrible in real life when the phone's being handled by a human. The shiny finish collects smudges and fingerprints, and the black color helps them stand out. The end result is that after a few days of real use, the old gloss-black iPhones generally had back covers that looked like they'd been worked over by a sticky-fingered toddler.\n\nAnd despite all of the complex jargon Ive used to describe the iPhone 7's \"new\" jet black finish, it shares the exact same problem as older black gloss finishes. Don't take my word for it; here's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/09\/fingerprints-look-much-worse-jet-black-iphone-7\/\"><em>Wired<\/em><\/a> on the new jet black phones:\n\n<blockquote> Most of [jet black iPhone 7 buyers] will admire their super shiny phone exactly once, because, as reviewers have noted, that lust-worthy luster turns into a serious smudgefest within minutes. Like, way worse than the not-jet-black black. Turns out, the same properties that make for superior sheen also attract fingerprints faster than a season of CSI: Miami.<\/blockquote>\n\nWhoops.\n\nAnd of course, glossy finishes tend to show scrapes and scratches more conspicuously too.\n\n<h2>Xiaomi-style sales tactics<\/h2>\n\nSo, you've got a not-really-new color that actually looks <em>worse<\/em> than any other iPhone color as soon as people put their hands on the phone. How do you sell that? You hype the crap out of it and then tell people supplies are limited.\n\n\n\nIn <em>Apple<\/em>'s defense, as a business tactic this works well. It certainly worked for Xiaomi in the early days. And given that jet black phones are mostly sold out across the globe, it's obviously working for <em>Apple<\/em>, too. It's not very consumer-friendly, though, because it encourages phone-scalping. And at least in China (<em>Apple<\/em>'s biggest market) it seems like things are already getting out of hand; Chinese media has reported <a href=\"http:\/\/tech.sina.com.cn\/mobile\/n\/n\/2016-09-16\/doc-ifxvyqvy6502165.shtml\">scalpers charging as much as US$3,000 for jet black iPhones<\/a>, having bought up all the supply themselves.\n\n<em>Apple<\/em> could have prevented this. Given that the phone's physical design is so similar to previous versions, it's very difficult to believe that time or technical limitations could have prevented <em>Apple<\/em> from producing more jet black phones if it had wanted to. And <em>Apple<\/em> certainly could (and should) have guessed that scalpers would be all over the jet black models given how much <em>Apple<\/em> hyped them during the launch event. But of course, <em>Apple<\/em> didn't <em>want<\/em> to prevent this, because news of the jet black phones being sold out is great marketing that makes the new phones seem desirable and more likely to sell better in the long run.\n\nWe can't blame <em>Apple<\/em> too much for trying to make money. But that doesn't mean we need to buy into this cheap trick. Buy whatever phone you want, but don't be fooled by the hype of jet black. And whatever you do, don't pay scalper prices for a phone that (I'd be willing to bet) will be available on a broad scale at list price within a few months.",

The courage to move on, do something new that betters all of us. And our team has tremendous courage.\"\n\nThis isn't courage, though. Apple's move to eliminate the headphone jack could have been courageous, but the company didn't go far enough. As it stands, the lightning headphone jack isn't courageous, it's just a crass money-grab.\n\n<h2>What is, and what could have been<\/h2>\n\nTo be clear, Apple has some <em>genuinely good reasons<\/em> for removing the old headphone jack. In principle, the lightning jack is just better. It takes up less space, and because it can send power as well as audio, it allows for some cool plug-in devices that won't need external power (like the batteryless noise-cancelling JBL headphones Apple showed off at its event).\n\nBut there are, of course, two main problems with removing the headphone jack as Apple has:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Using any older headphones now requires you to carry around an adapter. There's no way around it, this is inconvenient, and the entire point of having a mobile phone is to carry <em>less<\/em> stuff around, not more. <\/li>\n    <li>You can no longer use headphones while charging. As numerous people have pointed out, this breaks lots of people's habits and workflows. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\nApple's answer to the first problem is pretty simple: deal with it or buy new headphones. This makes sense since Apple owns a headphone company. But it also makes sense because \"buy new headphones\" is <em>also<\/em> Apple's answer to the second problem. You can listen with headphones while charging your phone if you grab <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beatsbydre.com\/headphones\/browse-headphones\/wireless-headphones\/MNEN2.html\">a pricey new pair of Beats<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/shop\/product\/MMEF2AM\/A\/airpods\">Apple's newly-announced Airpod earbuds<\/a>.\n\nThe Airpods were presented at today's event as Apple's vision of the future. <em>This<\/em>, Apple said, <em>is how things will look in the wireless world we're building by killing off the headphone jack<\/em>.\n\n<em>Oh, and by the way, these'll cost you an extra US$160.<\/em>\n\n(Sure, you could use a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones, but those won't magically auto-connect the way the Apple ones do. Plus, I doubt Apple's vision of the future entails you having to buy some <em>other<\/em> company's product to fully enjoy theirs).\n\n\n\n<h2>Cowards!<\/h2>\n\nThat price is where Apple's courage apparently failed. The company took away the iPhone's headphone jack and said \"Look, we have the <em>courage<\/em> to make this futuristic wireless-first phone.\" But Cook and company didn't really have the courage to present consumers with that vision. They didn't want to walk all the way out onto that limb. So instead, the iPhone 7 comes with an adapter and a pair of wired earbuds that'll be useless whenever your phone is charging. If you want a taste of the future, that'll cost you an <em>extra<\/em> US$160.\n\nYou know what <em>real<\/em> courage would have been? Throwing in those wireless Airpods for free.\n\nDoing that would have been a huge risk. It would hurt Apple's profitability in the short term. That, in turn, would probably knock the company's stock price down. Corporate suits would say it's not a good idea, even if the company could afford it (which it clearly could; the iPhone has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/digital-life\/mobiles\/apples-iphone-6-profit-margin-at-least-69-per-cent-report-20140924-10ld37.html\">ridiculous margins<\/a> and Apple has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/07\/26\/apples-cash-hoard-shrinks-for-the-first-time-in-seven-quarters.html\">ridiculously huge cash reserves<\/a> anyway).\n\n\n\nBut it would have been great. It would have been Apple saying \"Here's our new idea, we want to sell <em>everyone<\/em> on it. Because with the iPhone 7, wireless isn't an upgrade, it's the <em>core experience<\/em>.\" <em>That<\/em> would have been courageous. <em>That<\/em> would have been the kind of \"revolutionary\" move that Apple was once famous for.\n\nOf course, Apple didn't do that. Instead we got more of what Apple's been providing lately: weak sauce. Half measures. If you buy an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you won't actually get to experience Apple's wireless vision unless you pony up and buy <em>another<\/em> overpriced product on top of that. And without the wireless headphone experience, the single-lightning-port iPhone is just straight-up inferior to basically every other phone out there.\n\nI mean, say what you will about the \"totally redesigned\" home button (which is still a circular button that does all the same things). But even my old <em>iPhone 3G<\/em> would let me charge it up while watching Netflix.\n\nI was never a huge fan of Steve Jobs, nor do I believe that he's responsible for as much of Apple's success as he's often given credit for. But I think the company sorely missed him on the iPhone 7. Because whatever else you could say about Jobs, no one would deny that when he had a vision he stuck to it. Stubbornly. Unflinchingly.\n\nI think Jobs would have embraced the iPhone 7's vision of a default-wireless audio experience, even at the cost of making old headphones incompatible. But shipping a product where users (by default) <em>couldn't<\/em> experience that wireless audio vision? I can't imagine Jobs would have been on board with that.\n\nApple's vision of a wireless-headphone world? That's courageous (although not very original). It's just a shame that instead of giving that vision to us with the iPhone 7, Apple decided it would rather hawk extra headphones on the side.",

The courage to move on, do something new that betters all of us. And our team has tremendous courage.\"\n\nThis isn't courage, though. <em>Apple<\/em>'s move to eliminate the headphone jack could have been courageous, but the company didn't go far enough. As it stands, the lightning headphone jack isn't courageous, it's just a crass money-grab.\n\n<h2>What is, and what could have been<\/h2>\n\nTo be clear, <em>Apple<\/em> has some <em>genuinely good reasons<\/em> for removing the old headphone jack. In principle, the lightning jack is just better. It takes up less space, and because it can send power as well as audio, it allows for some cool plug-in devices that won't need external power (like the batteryless noise-cancelling JBL headphones <em>Apple<\/em> showed off at its event).\n\nBut there are, of course, two main problems with removing the headphone jack as <em>Apple<\/em> has:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Using any older headphones now requires you to carry around an adapter. There's no way around it, this is inconvenient, and the entire point of having a mobile phone is to carry <em>less<\/em> stuff around, not more. <\/li>\n    <li>You can no longer use headphones while charging. As numerous people have pointed out, this breaks lots of people's habits and workflows. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<em>Apple<\/em>'s answer to the first problem is pretty simple: deal with it or buy new headphones. This makes sense since <em>Apple<\/em> owns a headphone company. But it also makes sense because \"buy new headphones\" is <em>also<\/em> <em>Apple<\/em>'s answer to the second problem. You can listen with headphones while charging your phone if you grab <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beatsbydre.com\/headphones\/browse-headphones\/wireless-headphones\/MNEN2.html\">a pricey new pair of Beats<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/shop\/product\/MMEF2AM\/A\/airpods\"><em>Apple<\/em>'s newly-announced Airpod earbuds<\/a>.\n\nThe Airpods were presented at today's event as <em>Apple<\/em>'s vision of the future. <em>This<\/em>, <em>Apple<\/em> said, <em>is how things will look in the wireless world we're building by killing off the headphone jack<\/em>.\n\n<em>Oh, and by the way, these'll cost you an extra US$160.<\/em>\n\n(Sure, you could use a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones, but those won't magically auto-connect the way the <em>Apple<\/em> ones do. Plus, I doubt <em>Apple<\/em>'s vision of the future entails you having to buy some <em>other<\/em> company's product to fully enjoy theirs).\n\n\n\n<h2>Cowards!<\/h2>\n\nThat price is where <em>Apple<\/em>'s courage apparently failed. The company took away the iPhone's headphone jack and said \"Look, we have the <em>courage<\/em> to make this futuristic wireless-first phone.\" But Cook and company didn't really have the courage to present consumers with that vision. They didn't want to walk all the way out onto that limb. So instead, the iPhone 7 comes with an adapter and a pair of wired earbuds that'll be useless whenever your phone is charging. If you want a taste of the future, that'll cost you an <em>extra<\/em> US$160.\n\nYou know what <em>real<\/em> courage would have been? Throwing in those wireless Airpods for free.\n\nDoing that would have been a huge risk. It would hurt <em>Apple<\/em>'s profitability in the short term. That, in turn, would probably knock the company's stock price down. Corporate suits would say it's not a good idea, even if the company could afford it (which it clearly could; the iPhone has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/digital-life\/mobiles\/apples-iphone-6-profit-margin-at-least-69-per-cent-report-20140924-10ld37.html\">ridiculous margins<\/a> and <em>Apple<\/em> has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/07\/26\/apples-cash-hoard-shrinks-for-the-first-time-in-seven-quarters.html\">ridiculously huge cash reserves<\/a> anyway).\n\n\n\nBut it would have been great. It would have been <em>Apple<\/em> saying \"Here's our new idea, we want to sell <em>everyone<\/em> on it. Because with the iPhone 7, wireless isn't an upgrade, it's the <em>core experience<\/em>.\" <em>That<\/em> would have been courageous. <em>That<\/em> would have been the kind of \"revolutionary\" move that <em>Apple<\/em> was once famous for.\n\nOf course, <em>Apple<\/em> didn't do that. Instead we got more of what <em>Apple<\/em>'s been providing lately: weak sauce. Half measures. If you buy an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you won't actually get to experience <em>Apple<\/em>'s wireless vision unless you pony up and buy <em>another<\/em> overpriced product on top of that. And without the wireless headphone experience, the single-lightning-port iPhone is just straight-up inferior to basically every other phone out there.\n\nI mean, say what you will about the \"totally redesigned\" home button (which is still a circular button that does all the same things). But even my old <em>iPhone 3G<\/em> would let me charge it up while watching Netflix.\n\nI was never a huge fan of Steve Jobs, nor do I believe that he's responsible for as much of <em>Apple<\/em>'s success as he's often given credit for. But I think the company sorely missed him on the iPhone 7. Because whatever else you could say about Jobs, no one would deny that when he had a vision he stuck to it. Stubbornly. Unflinchingly.\n\nI think Jobs would have embraced the iPhone 7's vision of a default-wireless audio experience, even at the cost of making old headphones incompatible. But shipping a product where users (by default) <em>couldn't<\/em> experience that wireless audio vision? I can't imagine Jobs would have been on board with that.\n\n<em>Apple<\/em>'s vision of a wireless-headphone world? That's courageous (although not very original). It's just a shame that instead of giving that vision to us with the iPhone 7, <em>Apple<\/em> decided it would rather hawk extra headphones on the side.",

You probably know all about them already, but just in case you don't, here's are the basics:\n\nThe new phones are waterproof (IP67), so you can stop worrying about spills. Apple has also removed the old headphone jack and left only the lightning port, so you can also stop worrying about charging your phone and using headphones at the same time, too. Unless you buy the expensive new wireless Airpods separately, of course.\n\nThe new phones sport an upgraded camera (the 7 Plus even has a dual-lens camera) with optical image stabilization. Then there are the more predictable updates: the display is brighter, the chip is faster, the speakers are louder (and stereo!), etc.\n\nThe phones will cost exactly what you'd expect: US$649 for the smaller iPhone 7, and US$769 for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. But thankfully, <em>finally<\/em>, Apple has done away with the 16 GB option, so each phone is now available with a default storage of 32 GB, with available upgrades to 128 and 256 GB.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iphone2-750x406.jpg\" alt=\"iphone2\" width=\"750\" height=\"406\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-350428\" \/>\n\n<h2>Asia release details<\/h2>\n\nChina, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, will get the new iPhones on the same timeline as the US: orders open this Friday (Sept. 9), and the phones start shipping on the 16th. Everyone else, unfortunately, gets to wait a little bit, as Apple didn't announce a specific release date for any other Asian countries during the event.\n\nAdditionally, Apple announced that fans in China can now join Apple's iPhone subscription program, in which users can pay a monthly fee to be eligible for a new iPhone every year. Previously, that was only available to customers in the US.\n\nApple also launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-announces-apple-watch-series-2-making-older-watch-obsolete\">a new version of its Apple Watch<\/a>, but did not announce any Asia-specific launch dates.",

You probably know all about them already, but just in case you don't, here's are the basics:\n\nThe new phones are waterproof (IP67), so you can stop worrying about spills. <em>Apple<\/em> has also removed the old headphone jack and left only the lightning port, so you can also stop worrying about charging your phone and using headphones at the same time, too. Unless you buy the expensive new wireless Airpods separately, of course.\n\nThe new phones sport an upgraded camera (the 7 Plus even has a dual-lens camera) with optical image stabilization. Then there are the more predictable updates: the display is brighter, the chip is faster, the speakers are louder (and stereo!), etc.\n\nThe phones will cost exactly what you'd expect: US$649 for the smaller iPhone 7, and US$769 for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. But thankfully, <em>finally<\/em>, <em>Apple<\/em> has done away with the 16 GB option, so each phone is now available with a default storage of 32 GB, with available upgrades to 128 and 256 GB.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iphone2-750x406.jpg\" alt=\"iphone2\" width=\"750\" height=\"406\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-350428\" \/>\n\n<h2>Asia release details<\/h2>\n\nChina, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, will get the new iPhones on the same timeline as the US: orders open this Friday (Sept. 9), and the phones start shipping on the 16th. Everyone else, unfortunately, gets to wait a little bit, as <em>Apple<\/em> didn't announce a specific release date for any other Asian countries during the event.\n\nAdditionally, <em>Apple<\/em> announced that fans in China can now join <em>Apple<\/em>'s iPhone subscription program, in which users can pay a monthly fee to be eligible for a new iPhone every year. Previously, that was only available to customers in the US.\n\n<em>Apple<\/em> also launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-announces-apple-watch-series-2-making-older-watch-obsolete\">a new version of its <em>Apple<\/em> Watch<\/a>, but did not announce any Asia-specific launch dates.",

And it's <em>way<\/em> better.\n\nThe new watch, which Apple is calling the Watch Series 2, boasts some pretty serious upgrades over its predecessor, especially if you're a fitness buff. It's waterproof to 50 meters, and it now has a built-in GPS so that it can track activities like runs and hikes without needing to be paired with an iPhone. It also sports a new display that gets up to a ridiculous 1,000 nits of brightness - the brightest display Apple has ever put on any product - so that you can still read it easily outside on a sunny day.\n\nThere's even a special version Apple has created specifically for runners in partnership with Nike's Nike Plus.\n\nThere are also some basic upgrades. Among them: a new dual core processor that should make the watch a bit snappier.\n\nThe new series 2 watch starts at US$369, and you can preorder it on September 9. It goes on sale in the US on September 16, but Apple didn't share any details about the release dates for other regions. Apple is also upgrading its old watch with the new dual core processor, so if you want one of those but aren't interested in the other upgrades (like onboard GPS and waterproofing), you can still buy the older \"series 1\" starting at US$269.",

It's waterproof to 50 meters, and it now has a built-in GPS so that it can track activities like runs and hikes without needing to be paired with an iPhone. It also sports a new display that gets up to a ridiculous 1,000 nits of brightness - the brightest display <em>Apple<\/em> has ever put on any product - so that you can still read it easily outside on a sunny day.\n\nThere's even a special version <em>Apple<\/em> has created specifically for runners in partnership with Nike's Nike Plus.\n\nThere are also some basic upgrades. Among them: a new dual core processor that should make the watch a bit snappier.\n\nThe new series 2 watch starts at US$369, and you can preorder it on September 9. It goes on sale in the US on September 16, but <em>Apple<\/em> didn't share any details about the release dates for other regions. <em>Apple<\/em> is also upgrading its old watch with the new dual core processor, so if you want one of those but aren't interested in the other upgrades (like onboard GPS and waterproofing), you can still buy the older \"series 1\" starting at US$269.",

Now, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kantarworldpanel.com\/global\/News\/iOS-Returns-to-Growth-in-the-US-EU5\">a report<\/a> from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech confirms just how bad it was. According to Kantar, the iPhone's China market share has dropped to 17.9 percent, putting it behind domestic competitors Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nSpecifically, Kantar says that Huawei now has 25.7 percent of China's mobile market, while Xiaomi controls 18.5 percent of it. Apple's 17.9 percent is down 1.8 percent year-on-year; the company controlled nearly 20 percent of the market at this time last year.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-344401\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/china-smartphone-market-os-2016q2-750x563.jpeg\" alt=\"china-smartphone-market-os-2016q2\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\" \/>\n\nApple's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are still the top-selling smartphone models in China, according to Kantar. But domestic handsets like the Huawei Mate 8, Huawei P9, Xiaomi RedMi Note 3, Xiaomi Mi 5, and Oppo R9 are increasingly giving Apple a run for its money.\n\nThe saving grace for Apple in China might be strong demand for its budget-priced iPhone SE - supply constraints prevented that model from making a bigger sales dent, so if the phone becomes more readily available in Q3 its sales should see an uptick. Also, Apple will announce and launch its new iPhone 7 models in the third quarter. New models typically help drive sales up, so Apple's dip below Xiaomi could be just a temporary setback.\n\nKantar's numbers also show a drop in iPhone market share in Japan, from 42.2 percent of the market a year ago down to 38 percent this year. Although the iPhone still holds a larger chunk of the market in Japan than anywhere else Kantar surveyed (including the US), the year-on-year drop of 4.2 percent was also the worst in any region.",

Last quarter was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-china-q2-revenue\">record-breakingly bad for Apple<\/a>, so a further drop isn't exactly good news.\n\n<h3>This is the global overview of Apples revenues since 2013 for the five main geographies that it uses in its breakdown. Europe has edged past greater China to regain the number two spot:<\/h3>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Apple-revenues-Q3-2016-with-is-actually-Q2-in-real-human-normal-time-CHART-1.png\" alt=\"Apple\u2019s China revenue dropped off a cliff this quarter\" width=\"1720\" height=\"1480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-341555\" \/>\n\n<h3>And this is how it looks with the greater China region on its own:<\/h3>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Apple-revenues-Q3-2016-with-is-actually-Q2-in-real-human-normal-time-CHART-2.png\" alt=\"Apple\u2019s China revenue dropped off a cliff this quarter\" width=\"1722\" height=\"1464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-341556\" \/>\n\n<h2>Downer<\/h2>\n\nApple did get some good Asia news out of Japan. Japan revenues are actually up almost 23 percent year-on-year to US$3.53 billion. But the rest of Asia let the Cupertino company down, falling to US$2.38 billion - a 19.5 percent drop year-on-year. Apple's total revenues from across Asia add up to US$14.75 billion, a 22 percent year-on-year drop.\n\n\n\niPhone, iPad, and Mac unit sales numbers all dropped year-on-year as well, and again it was the iPhone that had the biggest slump, with unit sales dropping 15 percent year-on-year.\n\nBefore last quarter, iPhone sales had <em>never<\/em> dropped year-on-year and total revenue hadn't dropped since 2003. Now, both of those things have happened for two quarters in a row, and according to Apple's Q4 guidance, investors should expect another year-on-year drop in Q4.\n\nIf there's a silver lining for Apple, it's that these results are actually <em>less<\/em> bad than investors initially anticipated. In fact, Apple's stock actually <em>jumped<\/em> five points in after-hours trading following the release. Also, the company's services business - which Apple expects to play an increasingly important role - grew 19 percent year-on-year, although it still accounts for less than 15 percent of the company's total revenue.\n\n<h2>India stronger<\/h2>\n\nIn the company's earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook stressed (as he did last quarter) that 2015 was a particularly strong year of revenue growth for Apple, which makes living up to that standard difficult.\n\n\n\nBut he highlighted some additional areas the company sees as promising: the iPhone SE is doing well in emerging markets and bringing new customers onboard. And the Apple Watch remains the best-selling smartphone in the world (although there isn't much competition).\n\nBoth Tim Cook and Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that the company saw strong results in India, although they haven't yet shared specific numbers.\n\nDuring the Q&amp;A portion of the call, Cook was asked about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-gave-didi-kuaidi-biggest-investment\">Apple's investment in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi<\/a>, and said that the connection to Didi will help Apple learn about the Chinese market. He said Apple will make similar investments in the future, although big cash splashes won't be a regular occurrence.\n\nCook was also asked about China's recent ban on Apple Books and Apple Movies, but he sort of dodged the question, saying that the financial impact of the ban was minimal. That's doubtless true, but it may still trouble investors that Apple services business - which the company is touting as an important part of its future - is running into these sorts of regulatory roadblocks in one of the company's most important markets.\n\n(<strong>UPDATED eight hours after publishing:<\/strong> Added in the two charts and the Tim Cook photo.)",

             "content":"\n\n<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">E<\/em><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">arlier in May, Apple joined in the sharing economy with its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-apple-china-idUSKCN0Y404W\">US$1b investment in China\u2019s largest ride-sharing service, Didi Chuxing<\/a>. Ride-sharing marketplaces like Didi have been disrupting the traditional transportation economy, bringing the future of car ownership and public transport into question. What does Apple\u2019s move mean for the sharing economy?<\/em>\n\nApple, traditionally a smartphone provider, is slowly shifting towards being a services provider. Apple Pay, Music and CarPlay are some of the services it has started to offer since the turn of the decade. However, its investment in Didi marks its first foray into the on-demand economy, entering the company into unchartered waters. Apart from the increase in funding, we take a look at how the sharing economy will be affected by the investment.\n\n<h2><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">China will lead the way for the sharing economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nDespite the global economic slump, Didi has been experiencing exceptional growth since its inception in February 2015, with its valuation soaring from $6 billion to the $25 billion today. It dominates the ride-sharing market in China, beating out global giant Uber and completing 11 million rides daily (furthermore, this translates into 1 percent market penetration, leaving much room for expansion).\n\nDidi has been able to make use of a relative freedom in the Chinese market, as China aims to shift its economic focus towards higher-value services such as the technology Didi operates with. On the contrary, Uber has been embroiled in regulatory and legal issues in its home country, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/05\/08\/austin-voters-reject-uber-lyft-plan-for-self-regulation.html\">most recently fleeing Austin to avoid regulations, including fingerprint background checks on its drivers.<\/a> China looks increasingly promising as the key driver for the sharing economy in the future.\n\n<h2><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The sharing economy is a data treasure trove<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nWith on-demand services like Didi and Uber, cars can be summoned with a mobile app instantly to your location. Ride-sharing services are able to answer the question, \u201cHow many cars do we need if cars were to be shared\u201d with such precision due to the vast amounts of data that they collect in the marketplace. It enabled Didi to scale with this creation of data, analysing it to solve customers\u2019 needs. The data collected from its 1.43 billion rides in 2015 could even be used to anticipate traffic congestion and re-direct its drivers on the most efficient routes.\n\nSpeaking in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-apple-china-idUSKCN0Y404W?ref=il\">interview<\/a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook identified that the investment was \u201cfor a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market.\u201d Apple\u2019s investment in Didi enables it to <a href=\"http:\/\/amigobulls.com\/articles\/why-you-should-pay-attention-to-apple-inc-s-1-billion-didi-chuxing-invesment\">leverage on its data to optimize store locations based on the data<\/a> collected from 300 million users in more than 400 cities.\n\n<h2><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Marketplaces in the sharing economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nIn essence, a marketplace is a platform that aggregates masses of buyers and sellers together. The success of a marketplace predicates on the scale that it builds and the resulting network effects that comes with it. Apple\u2019s investment could allow it to latch onto these effects, allowing it to integrate its services such as CarPlay or iTunes into a larger audience. Marketplaces link the sharing economy together; serving as the meeting place for riders and drivers.\n\nWith Apple\u2019s investment, the benefits will only get better. Increased synchronization of Didi\u2019s marketplace with the Apple ecosystem can improve the user experience, simplifying the ride-hailing process even further. This would further boost the iPhone\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kantarworldpanel.com\/global\/News\/Apple-Ends-2015-as-Leading-Smartphone-Brand-in-US-China\">27 percent market share in the Chinese market.<\/a> For drivers, this provides a new opportunity to utilize their idle assets, or even spare time in the summer to earn an extra side income, especially with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/uber-market-share-35-percent-china\">large subsidies that Didi reportedly offers for its drivers<\/a>.\n\n<h2><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nSomewhere in the (near) future, in China, a passenger asks Siri to hail an Apple-provided self-driving car via Didi Chuxing, taking him to the latest Apple store that opened in the city. With Apple\u2019s latest investment, this scenario seems likelier than ever. People stand to gain from the increased precision of predictability gathered from deep data analyses. It could lead to increased efficiency in the transport industry. At the base of it all lies a marketplace, a platform that links riders and drivers, allowing people to breathe life into their idle assets and earn extra cash.",

Ride-sharing marketplaces like Didi have been disrupting the traditional transportation economy, bringing the future of car ownership and public transport into question. What does <em>Apple<\/em>\u2019s move mean for the sharing economy?<\/em>\n\n<em>Apple<\/em>, traditionally a smartphone provider, is slowly shifting towards being a services provider. <em>Apple<\/em> Pay, Music and CarPlay are some of the services it has started to offer since the turn of the decade. However, its investment in Didi marks its first foray into the on-demand economy, entering the company into unchartered waters. Apart from the increase in funding, we take a look at how the sharing economy will be affected by the investment.\n\n<h2><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">China will lead the way for the sharing economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nDespite the global economic slump, Didi has been experiencing exceptional growth since its inception in February 2015, with its valuation soaring from $6 billion to the $25 billion today. It dominates the ride-sharing market in China, beating out global giant Uber and completing 11 million rides daily (furthermore, this translates into 1 percent market penetration, leaving much room for expansion).\n\nDidi has been able to make use of a relative freedom in the Chinese market, as China aims to shift its economic focus towards higher-value services such as the technology Didi operates with. On the contrary, Uber has been embroiled in regulatory and legal issues in its home country, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/05\/08\/austin-voters-reject-uber-lyft-plan-for-self-regulation.html\">most recently fleeing Austin to avoid regulations, including fingerprint background checks on its drivers.<\/a> China looks increasingly promising as the key driver for the sharing economy in the future.\n\n<h2><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The sharing economy is a data treasure trove<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nWith on-demand services like Didi and Uber, cars can be summoned with a mobile app instantly to your location. Ride-sharing services are able to answer the question, \u201cHow many cars do we need if cars were to be shared\u201d with such precision due to the vast amounts of data that they collect in the marketplace. It enabled Didi to scale with this creation of data, analysing it to solve customers\u2019 needs. The data collected from its 1.43 billion rides in 2015 could even be used to anticipate traffic congestion and re-direct its drivers on the most efficient routes.\n\nSpeaking in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-apple-china-idUSKCN0Y404W?ref=il\">interview<\/a>, <em>Apple<\/em> CEO Tim Cook identified that the investment was \u201cfor a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market.\u201d <em>Apple<\/em>\u2019s investment in Didi enables it to <a href=\"http:\/\/amigobulls.com\/articles\/why-you-should-pay-attention-to-apple-inc-s-1-billion-didi-chuxing-invesment\">leverage on its data to optimize store locations based on the data<\/a> collected from 300 million users in more than 400 cities.\n\n<h2><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Marketplaces in the sharing economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nIn essence, a marketplace is a platform that aggregates masses of buyers and sellers together. The success of a marketplace predicates on the scale that it builds and the resulting network effects that comes with it. <em>Apple<\/em>\u2019s investment could allow it to latch onto these effects, allowing it to integrate its services such as CarPlay or iTunes into a larger audience. Marketplaces link the sharing economy together; serving as the meeting place for riders and drivers.\n\nWith <em>Apple<\/em>\u2019s investment, the benefits will only get better. Increased synchronization of Didi\u2019s marketplace with the <em>Apple<\/em> ecosystem can improve the user experience, simplifying the ride-hailing process even further. This would further boost the iPhone\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kantarworldpanel.com\/global\/News\/Apple-Ends-2015-as-Leading-Smartphone-Brand-in-US-China\">27 percent market share in the Chinese market.<\/a> For drivers, this provides a new opportunity to utilize their idle assets, or even spare time in the summer to earn an extra side income, especially with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/uber-market-share-35-percent-china\">large subsidies that Didi reportedly offers for its drivers<\/a>.\n\n<h2><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\nSomewhere in the (near) future, in China, a passenger asks Siri to hail an <em>Apple<\/em>-provided self-driving car via Didi Chuxing, taking him to the latest <em>Apple<\/em> store that opened in the city. With <em>Apple<\/em>\u2019s latest investment, this scenario seems likelier than ever. People stand to gain from the increased precision of predictability gathered from deep data analyses. It could lead to increased efficiency in the transport industry. At the base of it all lies a marketplace, a platform that links riders and drivers, allowing people to breathe life into their idle assets and earn extra cash.",

Those bring the tally of Apple Stores in China to 40, up from 15 when Cook said the expansion would start.\n\nThere are now 36 in the mainland plus four in Hong Kong.\n\nAs <a href=\"http:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/16\/06\/06\/apple-to-reach-goal-of-40-chinese-stores-later-in-june-with-outlets-in-shanghai-tianjin\">noticed by Apple Insider<\/a>, the two newest stores are in Shanghai (the sixth in the city) and Tianjin (its second one).\n\nApple's fulfilling its China promise may have more to do with its retail boss, Angela Ahrendts, than with the CEO. Ahrendts joined Apple in early 2014, leaving her post as Burberry CEO to rejuvenate the official Apple Stores and speed up their global expansion.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-china-q2-revenue\">Apple's most recent quarterly financials<\/a> may have been the company\u2019s worst in more than a decade, but the huge popularity of the iPhone in China, particularly since the iPhone 6 came out in 2014, has created a huge surge in revenue from the country.\n\nThe \"greater China\" area - the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan all grouped together - accounted for nearly double the revenue of Japan and the rest of the entire Asia-Pacific area combined at its peak at the end of 2015.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Apple-in-China-2016-chart-1.png\" alt=\"Apple hits goal of 40 stores in China\" width=\"950\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-331192\" \/>\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Apple's China revenue is trending upwards - and the company sees its own official stores in major cities as an important part of the strategy to win over the country's large middle class.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Apple-in-China-2016-chart-2.png\" alt=\"Apple hits goal of 40 stores in China\" width=\"950\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-331191\" \/>\n\nA radically refreshed iPhone 7 could see Apple hit new highs in China towards the end of the year.\n\n<strong>See: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-gave-didi-kuaidi-biggest-investment\">Apple invests $1 billion in Chinese ride-hailing app Didi<\/a><strong>",

Those bring the tally of <em>Apple<\/em> Stores in China to 40, up from 15 when Cook said the expansion would start.\n\nThere are now 36 in the mainland plus four in Hong Kong.\n\nAs <a href=\"http:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/16\/06\/06\/apple-to-reach-goal-of-40-chinese-stores-later-in-june-with-outlets-in-shanghai-tianjin\">noticed by <em>Apple<\/em> Insider<\/a>, the two newest stores are in Shanghai (the sixth in the city) and Tianjin (its second one).\n\n<em>Apple<\/em>'s fulfilling its China promise may have more to do with its retail boss, Angela Ahrendts, than with the CEO. Ahrendts joined <em>Apple<\/em> in early 2014, leaving her post as Burberry CEO to rejuvenate the official <em>Apple<\/em> Stores and speed up their global expansion.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-china-q2-revenue\"><em>Apple<\/em>'s most recent quarterly financials<\/a> may have been the company\u2019s worst in more than a decade, but the huge popularity of the iPhone in China, particularly since the iPhone 6 came out in 2014, has created a huge surge in revenue from the country.\n\nThe \"greater China\" area - the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan all grouped together - accounted for nearly double the revenue of Japan and the rest of the entire Asia-Pacific area combined at its peak at the end of 2015.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Apple-in-China-2016-chart-1.png\" alt=\"Apple hits goal of 40 stores in China\" width=\"950\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-331192\" \/>\n\nDespite the ups and downs, <em>Apple<\/em>'s China revenue is trending upwards - and the company sees its own official stores in major cities as an important part of the strategy to win over the country's large middle class.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Apple-in-China-2016-chart-2.png\" alt=\"Apple hits goal of 40 stores in China\" width=\"950\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-331191\" \/>\n\nA radically refreshed iPhone 7 could see <em>Apple<\/em> hit new highs in China towards the end of the year.\n\n<strong>See: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-gave-didi-kuaidi-biggest-investment\"><em>Apple<\/em> invests $1 billion in Chinese ride-hailing app Didi<\/a><strong>",

Initially, this trip was thought to be tied to Apple's sales and the censorship, but we wouldn't be surprised if he swings by Didi's offices as well.\n\n<h2>Lots of potential<\/h2>\n\nIt is unclear exactly what this new partnership will mean for Didi and Apple. The app's previous investors, such as Tencent and Alibaba, provided obvious advantages for payment systems, social media, and other web services.\n\nIn a statement released this morning, Tim Cook said that Didi \"exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\" and that the folks at Apple \"look forward to supporting them [Didi] as they grow.\" What this means (ride hailing buttons built into iOS? Sharing user data? Use of Apple Maps for Didi drivers abroad?) is still speculative.\n\n\n\nThis isn't Apple's first foray into the world of transportation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siliconrepublic.com\/companies\/2016\/05\/12\/apple-rd-pivot-project-titan-electric-car\">Rumors of an Apple-affiliated electric car<\/a> have been commonplace in tech circles for years, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072\">recent news<\/a> suggests that it may be close to release.\n\nDidi Chuxing is still in the midst of its current fundraising round. We'll see who else joins in as the round progresses, but one thing is clear - the anti-Uber alliance has some powerful players on its side.",

             "image":"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/sad-apple-2.jpg",
             "content":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/sad-apple-2-750x496.jpg\" alt=\"sad-apple-2\" width=\"750\" height=\"496\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-321664\" \/>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/04\/25\/technology\/apple-earnings\/\">Analysts expected<\/a> that when Apple announced its quarterly earnings this morning, it would be the company's worst quarter in more than a decade. Now, the results are in, and they're not pretty. iPhone sales have dropped year-on-year for the first time ever, and revenue dropped for the first time in a decade. And China, which has often been the engine of growth Apple can lean on in the lean times, saw a big drop, too.\n\nApple says that its revenue from the greater China area (China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) this quarter totaled US$12.49 billion. That number is down 26 percent year-on-year, and 32 percent compared to last quarter.\n\nIn the earnings call, Apple VP Luca Maestri stressed that Apple's record-breaking China Q2 last year, in which the company grew 82 percent, is very difficult to live up to.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Apple-revenue-in-record-fall-Q2-2016-fiscal-year-graph-1.png\" alt=\"Apple revenue in record fall, Q2 2016 fiscal year\" width=\"861\" height=\"749\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-321734\" \/>\n\n<h3>Here's the global picture:<\/h3>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Apple-revenue-in-record-fall-Q2-2016-fiscal-year-graph-2.png\" alt=\"Apple revenue in record fall, Q2 2016 fiscal year\" width=\"862\" height=\"744\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-321733\" \/>\n\nAs you see, the rest of Asia didn't fare much better.

Now, the results are in, and they're not pretty. iPhone sales have dropped year-on-year for the first time ever, and revenue dropped for the first time in a decade. And China, which has often been the engine of growth <em>Apple<\/em> can lean on in the lean times, saw a big drop, too.\n\n<em>Apple<\/em> says that its revenue from the greater China area (China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) this quarter totaled US$12.49 billion. That number is down 26 percent year-on-year, and 32 percent compared to last quarter.\n\nIn the earnings call, <em>Apple<\/em> VP Luca Maestri stressed that <em>Apple<\/em>'s record-breaking China Q2 last year, in which the company grew 82 percent, is very difficult to live up to.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Apple-revenue-in-record-fall-Q2-2016-fiscal-year-graph-1.png\" alt=\"Apple revenue in record fall, Q2 2016 fiscal year\" width=\"861\" height=\"749\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-321734\" \/>\n\n<h3>Here's the global picture:<\/h3>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Apple-revenue-in-record-fall-Q2-2016-fiscal-year-graph-2.png\" alt=\"Apple revenue in record fall, Q2 2016 fiscal year\" width=\"862\" height=\"744\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-321733\" \/>\n\nAs you see, the rest of Asia didn't fare much better.

Within those guidelines, and embedded within some of their other communications, are golden nuggets and sage words straight from the horse\u2019s mouth on how to make successful apps.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"ac21\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">If you\u2019re looking to make a living off apps, then you should listen up. This is 2016, and there\u2019s no room for amateurs and wantrepreneurs on the App Store. Let\u2019s dissect some of Apple\u2019s advice so you can make apps like a pro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #1 from Apple<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cWe have over a million Apps in the App Store. If your App doesn\u2019t do something useful, unique or provide some form of lasting entertainment, or if your app is plain creepy, it may not be accepted.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"e7d1\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"8297235fd29\">Be useful.<\/span> Solve a problem the user faces with a usable interface. You can be effective at this by taking a solution that exists and making it better, faster, easier, cheaper, safer or funnier. These words all describe value. Often times, a new product may be more than one of these. Consider how you\u2019re making the someone\u2019s life better. Rethink, refresh, redesign, and recreate things. Remix the old, and make the new.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"4fd2\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, consider the podcast app <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/\">Overcast<\/a>. As a product, it\u2019s certainly not the one with the most comprehensive list of features. Instead of trying to fight many battles, it enhances its odds of winning by focusing on a few. One of its unique abilities is one that helps users save time by automatically speeding up and skipping through silence in a podcast.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"2bf0\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Considering how podcasts have been around for a decade, and how Overcast for a relatively short time, this slight additional utility still made it an extremely popular app. It does podcasting very well and improves on the experience in a specific way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #2 from Apple<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cBefore creating your app, take a look at the apps in your category on the App Store and consider how you can provide an even better user experience.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"4e01\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Make something unique. This is meant in the context of the App Store. Does what you plan to build exist already? What can you do to differentiate yourself? Do your research.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"a618\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Conventional methods yield conventional results. Instead of building something old with enhanced efficiency, with this principle you\u2019re going to be building something completely new. You\u2019ll be doing something that hasn\u2019t been done before. Apple says that this is one of the top reasons apps get rejected from the App Store. \u201cIf your app doesn\u2019t offer much functionality or content, or only applies to a small niche market, it may not be approved,\u201d Apple wrote <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/review\/rejections\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/review\/rejections\/\">on their website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #3 from Apple<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cApple places a high value on clean, refined, and user-friendly interfaces. Make sure your UI meets these requirements by planning your design carefully and following our <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/\">design guides<\/a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/tips\/\">UI Design Dos and Don\u2019ts<\/a>.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"2eed\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Apple is notorious for their attention to detail. The <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/www.folklore.org\/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Signing_Party.txt&amp;topic=Apple%20Spirit&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.folklore.org\/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Signing_Party.txt&amp;topic=Apple%20Spirit&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium\">original team signed the inside of the Macintosh<\/a>, even when they knew little to nobody would see it. In an age where your competitors are obsessed over quantity, you will win by paying attention to quality.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"4f53\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">When it comes to building apps, our mantra is to \u201cMake it feature worthy.\u201d People should be thrilled at how enjoyable and beautiful it is, and press should want to cover it. These little details like the app icon, UI sounds, and small parts of the user interface add up to <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/littlebigdetails.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/littlebigdetails.com\/\">make a big difference<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #4 from Apple:<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cIf your App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you\u2019re trying to get your first practice App into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don\u2019t want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"bbc1\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">There are over <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2016\/01\/06\/app-store-1-1-billion-record-holiday-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2016\/01\/06\/app-store-1-1-billion-record-holiday-sales\/\">1.6 million apps on the App Store<\/a>. It\u2019s not a playground for hobbyists and amateurs to share their first apps or half-baked beta builds. Many other developers have put in hundreds (thousands!) of hours into crafting their apps before even attempting to get it published. As such, Apple\u2019s role as a gatekeeper is as important as ever.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"574d\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Spend the time to get it right, the first time. QA your app carefully. Share it with beta testers. Use it yourself. Try it out on older devices. Fix every possible bug you can find before uploading that V1 build, because chances are you\u2019ll still have missed some.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"e2b7\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Don\u2019t submit your app until you\u2019re confident that it\u2019s worthy of four or five stars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #5 from Apple<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cLastly, we love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We\u2019re really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living too. If it sounds like we\u2019re control freaks, well, maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products. Just like almost all of you are, too.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"ae87\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Like all other organizations, Apple works in their own interest. Accepting and promoting apps that are useful, differentiated, have an intuitive user interface, glowing user reviews, and press coverage is in their interest. So do them and yourself a favor, and create the best app that you can.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"80dd\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Closing thoughts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p id=\"033f\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">This was somewhat of a serious piece (minus the GIFs), and I\u2019d be the last to say you can\u2019t \u201chave fun\u201d as you build for the App Store. Always remember that <span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">for each moment you rest on your laurels there are other experienced developers, entrepreneurs, and designers looking to replace the product that you put together<\/span>. Attention is a zero sum game.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"9b9e\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">The major lesson here is to create apps that are useful, unique, well-designed, and refined. Make apps that improve peoples lives in small, but meaningful ways.<\/p>",

Within those guidelines, and embedded within some of their other communications, are golden nuggets and sage words straight from the horse\u2019s mouth on how to make successful apps.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"ac21\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">If you\u2019re looking to make a living off apps, then you should listen up. This is 2016, and there\u2019s no room for amateurs and wantrepreneurs on the App Store. Let\u2019s dissect some of Apple\u2019s advice so you can make apps like a pro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #1 from Apple<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cWe have over a million Apps in the App Store.

As a product, it\u2019s certainly not the one with the most comprehensive list of features. Instead of trying to fight many battles, it enhances its odds of winning by focusing on a few.

The <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/www.folklore.org\/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Signing_Party.txt&amp;topic=Apple%20Spirit&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.folklore.org\/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Signing_Party.txt&amp;topic=Apple%20Spirit&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium\">original team signed the inside of the Macintosh<\/a>, even when they knew little to nobody would see it. In an age where your competitors are obsessed over quantity, you will win by paying attention to quality.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"4f53\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">When it comes to building apps, our mantra is to \u201cMake it feature worthy.\u201d People should be thrilled at how enjoyable and beautiful it is, and press should want to cover it. These little details like the app icon, UI sounds, and small parts of the user interface add up to <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/littlebigdetails.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/littlebigdetails.com\/\">make a big difference<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #4 from Apple:<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cIf your App looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you\u2019re trying to get your first practice App into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don\u2019t want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"bbc1\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">There are over <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2016\/01\/06\/app-store-1-1-billion-record-holiday-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2016\/01\/06\/app-store-1-1-billion-record-holiday-sales\/\">1.6 million apps on the App Store<\/a>. It\u2019s not a playground for hobbyists and amateurs to share their first apps or half-baked beta builds. Many other developers have put in hundreds (thousands!) of hours into crafting their apps before even attempting to get it published. As such, Apple\u2019s role as a gatekeeper is as important as ever.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"574d\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Spend the time to get it right, the first time. QA your app carefully. Share it with beta testers. Use it yourself. Try it out on older devices. Fix every possible bug you can find before uploading that V1 build, because chances are you\u2019ll still have missed some.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"e2b7\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Don\u2019t submit your app until you\u2019re confident that it\u2019s worthy of four or five stars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #5 from Apple<\/h2>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cLastly, we love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We\u2019re really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living too. If it sounds like we\u2019re control freaks, well, maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products. Just like almost all of you are, too.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"ae87\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Like all other organizations, Apple works in their own interest. Accepting and promoting apps that are useful, differentiated, have an intuitive user interface, glowing user reviews, and press coverage is in their interest. So do them and yourself a favor, and create the best app that you can.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"80dd\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Closing thoughts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p id=\"033f\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">This was somewhat of a serious piece (minus the GIFs), and I\u2019d be the last to say you can\u2019t \u201chave fun\u201d as you build for the App Store. Always remember that <span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">for each moment you rest on your laurels there are other experienced developers, entrepreneurs, and designers looking to replace the product that you put together<\/span>. Attention is a zero sum game.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"9b9e\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">The major lesson here is to create apps that are useful, unique, well-designed, and refined. Make apps that improve peoples lives in small, but meaningful ways.<\/p>",

That means that you can now use WeChat pay for all of your Apple gadget and accessory needs.\n\nWeChat Pay isn't the only epayment system Apple accepts, of course. Obviously Apple's buyers can also use Apple Pay, and the Chinese version of Apple's online store also accepts Alipay, Alibaba's epayment platform.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-315239\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Z-750x344.jpg\" alt=\"Z\" width=\"750\" height=\"344\" \/>\n\nChina's fragmented online payment market and the relative lack of credit cards means that Chinese users actually have a lot more payment options than most people when it comes to buying Apple's products. Whereas Americans can pay only with PayPal or one of four major credit card providers, Chinese Apple fans can make online payments directly from ten major banks, pay with Visa, Mastercard, Alipay, or WeChat Pay, or even order items for cash-on-delivery.",

That means that you can now use WeChat pay for all of your Apple gadget and accessory needs.\n\nWeChat Pay isn't the only epayment system Apple accepts, of course. Obviously Apple's buyers can also use Apple Pay, and the Chinese version of Apple's online store also accepts Alipay, Alibaba's epayment platform.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-315239\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Z-750x344.jpg\" alt=\"Z\" width=\"750\" height=\"344\" \/>\n\nChina's fragmented online payment market and the relative lack of credit cards means that Chinese users actually have a lot more payment options than most people when it comes to buying Apple's products. Whereas Americans can pay only with PayPal or one of four major credit card providers, Chinese Apple fans can make online payments directly from ten major banks, pay with Visa, Mastercard, Alipay, or WeChat Pay, or even order items for cash-on-delivery.",

Apple has built two 20 megawatt solar farms in Sichuan, for example, that help move the company towards its renewable goals while maintaining the usability of the local farmland for yak farmers. In Singapore, where space is at a premium, Apple has put solar arrays on more than 800 rooftops.\n\n\"Every time you send an iMessage,\" Jackson said, \"you can feel really good about reducing your impact on the environment.\"\n\nApple's achievement is certainly impressive, but there <em>is<\/em> a bit of an asterisk that Jackson didn't share: it only applies to Apple's own facilities, not those of its suppliers and subcontractors.

That means your iPhone isn't carbon-neutral even though the Apple Store you bought it from is. Still, 100 percent carbon neutral Apple operations in China, Singapore, and the US is a damn good start!\n\nApple also announced a few other environmental efforts, including ongoing forest preservation efforts in China and a new robot named \"Liam\" that will deconstruct recycled iPhones to recover more of the materials for reuse.",

             "content":"Apple launched its mobile payments system Apple Pay in China this morning, leaping in to a heated battle between WeChat and Alibaba's Alipay.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook took to Weibo this morning to herald the rollout of the service, which will work in stores and on some websites. \"Apple Pay launching in China today. Can't wait for you to try it and see how incredibly easy it is to use!\" <a href=\"http:\/\/weibo.com\/5524254784\/Dim8ol1hd?from=page_1005055524254784_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime\">he wrote<\/a> in English and Chinese.\n\n\n\nThe Apple Pay rollout in China will be faster than in any other country. Whereas Apple has expanded slowly in the US and other markets by making partnerships with individual banks, in China the company has buddied up with UnionPay, the sole domestic bank card organization and interbank network in the country. That means Apple Pay works with most China-issued debit and credit cards, and will be accepted at any store or restaurant that has installed the new breed of NFC-enabled PIN input dongles issued by UnionPay.\n\n\n\nThat gives Apple Pay a huge footprint from day one.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Apple's new arch-rivals have expanded more slowly because they're going against the monopolistic UnionPay. Tencent's popular chat app WeChat and its baked-in mobile wallet and Alibaba spin-off app Alipay have had to get stores or chains to sign up to use their services and also install a barcode scanner into their cash registers. But after a head start of a couple of years, both WeChat Pay and Alibaba are now widely accepted at stores of all sizes across China, including major chains such as Uniqlo, FamilyMart, and Sam's Club.\n\nAs my experiment last year showed, it's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/day-with-wechat-payments-in-stores\">pretty easy to go entirely cashless in China<\/a> using a mix of WeChat and Alipay. That leaves little room for Apple, despite the apparent benefit of the UnionPay partnership.\n\nThe heated battle between WeChat Pay and Alipay across China means that the services are offering discounts at certain stores, with the Chinese tech titans picking up the tab so that their users can get the benefit of a price-cut with their cashless transaction.",

Can't wait for you to try it and see how incredibly easy it is to use!\" <a href=\"http:\/\/weibo.com\/5524254784\/Dim8ol1hd?from=page_1005055524254784_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime\">he wrote<\/a> in English and Chinese.\n\n\n\nThe Apple Pay rollout in China will be faster than in any other country. Whereas Apple has expanded slowly in the US and other markets by making partnerships with individual banks, in China the company has buddied up with UnionPay, the sole domestic bank card organization and interbank network in the country. That means Apple Pay works with most China-issued debit and credit cards, and will be accepted at any store or restaurant that has installed the new breed of NFC-enabled PIN input dongles issued by UnionPay.\n\n\n\nThat gives Apple Pay a huge footprint from day one.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Apple's new arch-rivals have expanded more slowly because they're going against the monopolistic UnionPay. Tencent's popular chat app WeChat and its baked-in mobile wallet and Alibaba spin-off app Alipay have had to get stores or chains to sign up to use their services and also install a barcode scanner into their cash registers. But after a head start of a couple of years, both WeChat Pay and Alibaba are now widely accepted at stores of all sizes across China, including major chains such as Uniqlo, FamilyMart, and Sam's Club.\n\nAs my experiment last year showed, it's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/day-with-wechat-payments-in-stores\">pretty easy to go entirely cashless in China<\/a> using a mix of WeChat and Alipay. That leaves little room for Apple, despite the apparent benefit of the UnionPay partnership.\n\nThe heated battle between WeChat Pay and Alipay across China means that the services are offering discounts at certain stores, with the Chinese tech titans picking up the tab so that their users can get the benefit of a price-cut with their cashless transaction.",

             "content":"Apple saw iPhone sales in India rise a whopping 76 percent in India in the final three months of 2015, the company said overnight. But the company should not be popping the champagne just yet.\n\nWhile Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-quarter-china\">posted strong numbers around the world<\/a>, analysts will likely be unhappy that the iPhone\u2019s era of hypergrowth is mostly over.\n\nExcept for in India, where it\u2019s just beginning.\n\nIndia\u2019s iPhone sales growth far outpaced China\u2019s - just 20 percent - in the previous quarter, CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imore.com\/tim-apples-ceo-q1-2016\">said on a call with analysts<\/a>.\n\n\u201cAnd as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in the first quarter was up 38 percent,\u201d he added. India is lumped in with the \u201crest of Asia-Pacific\u201d in Apple\u2019s financials.\n\n\n\nThat all major tech companies in the world are spending some serious time wooing Indians is not news anymore. Just ask <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/575201\/google-is-tapping-indias-regional-languages-and-villages-to-get-the-next-billion-users-online\/\">Google or Facebook<\/a>.\n\nApple has been a little late to the game, what with its products being exorbitantly priced, and Indians liking to count their pennies.\n\nBut as of the past few months, the company has doubled down on the market, expanding its distributor base, bringing in easy financing schemes for its phones, and even launching its first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7kxXVnAtnOQ\">TV spot for the Indian buyer<\/a>.\n\n<h2>When in India<\/h2>\n\nThose efforts showed results. Apple does not break down sales for India, but Tarun Pathak, senior analyst for mobile devices and ecosystems at research firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.counterpointresearch.com\/\">Counterpoint Technology Market Research<\/a> said the company sold 800,000 iPhones in India during the fourth quarter of 2015, better than ever before.\n\n800,000 is a whole world of improvement over the 500,000 iPhones Apple sold during the same period in 2014.\n\nApple\u2019s 800,000 in India compares with about 20 million iPhone sales in China. While the media calls <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/Apple-sees-bright-spot-in-India-as-China-loses-appetite-for-iPhones\/articleshow\/50738430.cms\">India the \u201cbright spot\u201d in Apple\u2019s results<\/a>, the country isn\u2019t going to make any major difference in Apple\u2019s balance sheet in the near future.\n\n\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun said the company accounted for less than 2 percent share of the smartphone market in India as of 2015, while market leader Samsung held 25 percent.\n\nSamsung makes some smartphones that can be bought for as little as US$90, which gives it a bigger playing field. But Apple still has a fine balancing act to get right in the country. It\u2019s not fighting Android in the country, it\u2019s fighting itself.\n\n<h2>They\u2019re still on the 4s<\/h2>\n\nAcross the world, Apple lives off an almost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/390133\/iphone-6s-launch-photos\/\">cultish following that peaks over new gadget launches<\/a>.

But the company should not be popping the champagne just yet.\n\nWhile Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-quarter-china\">posted strong numbers around the world<\/a>, analysts will likely be unhappy that the iPhone\u2019s era of hypergrowth is mostly over.\n\nExcept for in India, where it\u2019s just beginning.\n\nIndia\u2019s iPhone sales growth far outpaced China\u2019s - just 20 percent - in the previous quarter, CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imore.com\/tim-apples-ceo-q1-2016\">said on a call with analysts<\/a>.\n\n\u201cAnd as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in the first quarter was up 38 percent,\u201d he added. India is lumped in with the \u201crest of Asia-Pacific\u201d in Apple\u2019s financials.\n\n\n\nThat all major tech companies in the world are spending some serious time wooing Indians is not news anymore. Just ask <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/575201\/google-is-tapping-indias-regional-languages-and-villages-to-get-the-next-billion-users-online\/\">Google or Facebook<\/a>.\n\nApple has been a little late to the game, what with its products being exorbitantly priced, and Indians liking to count their pennies.\n\nBut as of the past few months, the company has doubled down on the market, expanding its distributor base, bringing in easy financing schemes for its phones, and even launching its first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7kxXVnAtnOQ\">TV spot for the Indian buyer<\/a>.\n\n<h2>When in India<\/h2>\n\nThose efforts showed results. Apple does not break down sales for India, but Tarun Pathak, senior analyst for mobile devices and ecosystems at research firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.counterpointresearch.com\/\">Counterpoint Technology Market Research<\/a> said the company sold 800,000 iPhones in India during the fourth quarter of 2015, better than ever before.\n\n800,000 is a whole world of improvement over the 500,000 iPhones Apple sold during the same period in 2014.\n\nApple\u2019s 800,000 in India compares with about 20 million iPhone sales in China. While the media calls <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/Apple-sees-bright-spot-in-India-as-China-loses-appetite-for-iPhones\/articleshow\/50738430.cms\">India the \u201cbright spot\u201d in Apple\u2019s results<\/a>, the country isn\u2019t going to make any major difference in Apple\u2019s balance sheet in the near future.\n\n\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun said the company accounted for less than 2 percent share of the smartphone market in India as of 2015, while market leader Samsung held 25 percent.\n\nSamsung makes some smartphones that can be bought for as little as US$90, which gives it a bigger playing field. But Apple still has a fine balancing act to get right in the country. It\u2019s not fighting Android in the country, it\u2019s fighting itself.\n\n<h2>They\u2019re still on the 4s<\/h2>\n\nAcross the world, Apple lives off an almost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/390133\/iphone-6s-launch-photos\/\">cultish following that peaks over new gadget launches<\/a>. That is the driver of sales for the company.

That's up more than 14 percent year-on-year. That number also beat's Apple's previous China best (US$16.14 billion), making this past quarter Apple's best-ever quarter in terms of China revenues.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Apple-FY-Q1-2016-chart-1.png\" alt=\"Apple just had its best quarter ever in China\" width=\"900\" height=\"720\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-299027\" \/>\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Apple-FY-Q1-2016-chart-2.png\" alt=\"Apple just had its best quarter ever in China\" width=\"900\" height=\"711\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-299029\" \/>\n\nThis quarter's numbers were (unsurprisingly) fueled by the company's highest-ever China iPhone sales totals. China iPhone sales grew 18 percent this quarter, according to Cook, and almost half of the iPhones sold this quarter were to first-time buyers, which suggests Apple hasn't come close to saturating the market. China also saw 27 percent year-on-year growth in Mac sales.\n\nCook said that despite the signs of economic trouble in China, Apple remains optimistic and will not change its investment plans in the country. The company will continue to invest in retail stores, and it plans to have built another 12 (to add to the 28 it already has) in the China region by this summer.",

But if you\u2019re an investor, this may smell like China\u2019s peak rather than its growth.\n\nAlthough Apple still has room for <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/digits\/2015\/08\/24\/apple-still-growing-strong-in-china-cook-says\/\">growth in China<\/a>, it appears that the smartphone giant is now looking down south to Southeast Asia. Consider the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leaked rumors of Apple opening up its own outlet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-location-singapore-store-confirmed\/\">in Singapore<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Apple is also opening up a subsidiary <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/11\/05\/us-apple-vietnam-idUSKCN0SU1UZ20151105#eX7wdQhKx4JFXk5p.97\">in Vietnam<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Apple hiring for a retail build manager <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/finally-apple-opens-office-indonesia\/\">in Jakarta<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nBeyond these first steps into Southeast Asia, let\u2019s consider the numbers. In 2013, Android was <a href=\"http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/asia\/2012\/09\/04\/android-southeast-asia-ericsson-report\/\">leading Southeast Asia<\/a> over iOS. But this is still true of China also. As Apple has shown, marketshare isn\u2019t the winning strategy for them, it\u2019s positioning. Most smartphone owners, as they realize the importance of the smartphone to their lives, want to move up the chain to the best smartphones, and this is where Apple positions itself successfully. It\u2019s why Apple is killing it in China.\n\nBy this logic, if we consider that Android has slowly come to dominate Southeast Asia, than it\u2019s only natural for iOS to slowly encroach on this. Southeast Asians are just as status conscious as Chinese people are.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about time Apple opens up in Southeast Asia. It just did <a href=\"http:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2015\/10\/15\/apple-store-dubai-abu-dhabi-launch\/\">in the Middle East<\/a>, in a region of over 200 million people. Now, here come the Apple Stores for a region of over 600 million people.",

Consider the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leaked rumors of Apple opening up its own outlet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-location-singapore-store-confirmed\/\">in Singapore<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Apple is also opening up a subsidiary <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/11\/05\/us-apple-vietnam-idUSKCN0SU1UZ20151105#eX7wdQhKx4JFXk5p.97\">in Vietnam<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Apple hiring for a retail build manager <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/finally-apple-opens-office-indonesia\/\">in Jakarta<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\nBeyond these first steps into Southeast Asia, let\u2019s consider the numbers. In 2013, Android was <a href=\"http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/asia\/2012\/09\/04\/android-southeast-asia-ericsson-report\/\">leading Southeast Asia<\/a> over iOS. But this is still true of China also. As Apple has shown, marketshare isn\u2019t the winning strategy for them, it\u2019s positioning. Most smartphone owners, as they realize the importance of the smartphone to their lives, want to move up the chain to the best smartphones, and this is where Apple positions itself successfully. It\u2019s why Apple is killing it in China.\n\nBy this logic, if we consider that Android has slowly come to dominate Southeast Asia, than it\u2019s only natural for iOS to slowly encroach on this. Southeast Asians are just as status conscious as Chinese people are.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about time Apple opens up in Southeast Asia. It just did <a href=\"http:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2015\/10\/15\/apple-store-dubai-abu-dhabi-launch\/\">in the Middle East<\/a>, in a region of over 200 million people. Now, here come the Apple Stores for a region of over 600 million people.",

The service is currently only available in the US and the United Kingdom.\n\nObviously Amex's announcement focuses on its own cards, but it's only reasonable to expect that other credit card providers and banks will get in on the action. In any case, Amex says that customers will be able to use their iPhone, iPad, and\/or Apple Watch to pay in stores that accept contactless payments and American Express cards.\n\n2016 will be big for Apple in Singapore, if indications about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/apple-location-singapore-store-confirmed\/\">a possible Apple Store<\/a> opening in the country prove to be true.\n\n<em>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/business\/apple-pay-coming-to\/2222788.html\">Channel News Asia<\/a><\/em>\n\n<em>Are you eagerly awaiting Apple Pay's arrival in Singapore?
