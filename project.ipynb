      "Article 1: Podcast: Rounding up SEA tech news with Momentum Works Sea and Grab recently released earnings results and as always, any financial news regarding the two Southeast Asian giants gets a lot of attention. No wonder then that the first episode of the new Momentum Works podcast focused on the two firms. The venture builder and research firm recently launched Impulso, a podcast that dives into tech trends in Asia. Featuring CEO Jianggang Li, engagement manager Sabrina Chong, and insights lead Saniya Ramchandani, the episode highlights the competition Sea faces in the ecommerce space, as well as stagnating gross merchandise value for Grab. The news roundup also touches on regulations for generative AI, and Luckin Coffee’s attempted comeback. Here are four highlights we picked out from the episode: 4:45 – Why Momentum Works’ analysts estimate that Shopee is operating with a 10% take rate 16:59 – Why Grab will probably achieve its goal of profitability in the fourth quarter of this year 22:40 – Why calls to regulate artificial intelligence from OpenAI’s CEO may be self-serving 30: 50 – Why Momentum Works’ analysts aren’t sure if Luckin Coffee can make it in Singapore\n",
      "Article 2: Paytm stock jumps 11.6% on news of Sharma’s stake purchase Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder and CEO of One97 Communications, has entered into an agreement with Ant Financial to buy the latter's 10.30% stake in the Indian company. The value of the 10.30% stake was estimated to be US$628 million as of August 4. The move was announced by Paytm, the payments platform operating under One97 Communications, on Monday. The purchase will be made via Sharma's owned overseas entity, Resilient Asset Management BV. With this, Sharma's ownership of Paytm will increase to 19.42%. Ant's ownership, on the other hand, will drop to 13.5%. The sale would help alleviate pressure from investors, who had been concerned over a potential share sell-off by Ant Group, and address concerns from rising India-China tensions, The Straits Times noted. The stock price of Paytm has since jumped 11.6% to 887 Indian rupees (US$10.7) apiece as of earlier today. In February, it was reported that Ant Group was mulling selling part of its stake in Paytm, which had exceeded 25% at the time. However, sources told Bloomberg that the potential sale was not driven by political reasons. \"I am proud of Paytm's role as a true champion of made-in-India financial innovation and our achievements in revolutionizing mobile payments and contributing to formal financial services inclusion in the country,\" Sharma said in a post. Founded in August 2010, Paytm started by providing prepaid mobile recharges but has since expanded into areas like ecommerce, banking, and insurance. Earlier this year, after the company narrowed its losses from US$94 million to US$47 million, Sharma said its next milestone was to generate free cash flow.

      "Article 3: Indonesia to require Google, Meta to compensate news publishers Indonesia has introduced a new presidential decree that will require digital platforms like Meta and Google to pay news publishers in exchange for distributing their content. The new law will go into effect six months after yesterday's signing by outgoing president Joko Widodo (Jokowi). Dubbed the Publisher Rights decree, it stipulates that digital platforms are responsible for maintaining a healthy news publishing business. Among the ways they can do so include designing a news distribution algorithm that supports quality journalism as well as partnering with news publishers. These partnerships may comprise a paid licensing arrangement, profit sharing, data sharing, or any other agreed type. In an event celebrating Indonesia's national press day, Jokowi noted that the Publisher Rights decree was initiated by media firms themselves, not the government. \"We want journalism that is high quality, journalism that is far from negative content, journalism that educate for Indonesia's development,\" he said. In a statement quoted by CNBC Indonesia, Google touted the importance of access to \"diverse news sources\" as well as an ecosystem that would help both big and small publishers to develop. Over the years, Google and Facebook have become important distribution channels for news. However, this has led to plummeting advertising revenue for publishers. Indonesia's new decree follows those already implemented in Australia and Canada, with several other countries likely to follow suit.\n",
      "Article 4: TikTok faces scrutiny in Malaysia over fake news After TikTok recently shut down its ecommerce feature in Indonesia, the short-video app is now under fire in Malaysia due to an apparent spread of fake news on the platform. Fahmi Fadzil, Malaysia's minister of communication, said in a social media post that TikTok's efforts to comply with the country's regulations are \"unsatisfactory.\" \"I emphasized that TikTok must operate in accordance with Malaysia's guidelines and laws,\" Fadzil said in the post, which came after a meeting with representatives from the social media firm on Wednesday. He added that TikTok acknowledged its shortcomings, blaming it on \"the absence of a representative in Malaysia.\" The company's point person in the meeting was Helena Lersch, ByteDance's Singapore-based vice president of public policy for emerging markets. While the meeting also discussed TikTok Shop, Fadzil did not provide details in his post. However, Malaysia was reportedly considering a similar move to Indonesia's ban of ecommerce transactions on social media platforms. In response to the minister's statement, a TikTok spokesperson said the platform respects local regulations and is committed to \"taking proactive measures to address the issues raised.\" The spokesperson added that the firm has organized follow-up meetings with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission next week. Besides Malaysia, Vietnam is also probing TikTok's operations due to the presence of \"toxic\" content on the platform. See also: TikTok Shop ban in Indonesia: Who is it really protecting?\n",

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription. Hello reader, I recently started a new hobby: collecting basketball cards. I’m really not sure why I felt the urge to do so. I joke with my friends that this might be my version of a midlife crisis response, but I’m having a great time so far. I’ve gotten some relatively valuable cards (or “hits” in the hobby’s parlance) such as autographed ones or those of up-and-coming rookies. This adds another hobby to a growing list. I still have a ton of books, shows, and games to get to. But I think it’s a good problem to have, and it’s nice to feel childlike enthusiasm about something, which is hard to experience nowadays as a Responsible Member of SocietyTM. This variety is also present in today’s list of companies that received funding or were involved in M&As. AI-backed financial solutions, spacetech, and DIY meal kits, among others, are all represented. Let’s hope we can all always find new things to get excited about. Have a good weekend, folks. You can find all other important investment deals that happened over the last few days in our weekly funding news wrap-up. Let’s dive into the biggest deals and M&As that recently took place.

Killer pitch decks 1️⃣ Bukalapak used this pitch deck to land its seed round The ecommerce major is one of Indonesia’s most prominent tech companies, but it wasn’t always easy to shore up funds. According to Bukalapak co-founder Achmad Zaky, the startup’s seed round pitch deck didn’t go a long way toward raising money. The company only managed to bring in capital about six months after the presentation was created in 2011. 2️⃣ This women-focused firm scored pre-seed funding via this pitch deck Lucy is a mobile app that provides financial support for women entrepreneurs. Officially slated to launch in Singapore in early 2021, the company used this pitch deck to raise a US$365,787 pre-seed round from 18 women investors. The presentation showcases Lucy’s brand characteristics, detailing how the startup is guided by its mission of helping women “who are overlooked, underestimated, and underbanked become unstoppable by leveling the financial playing field.” 3️⃣ An experiential VR startup used this deck to bag US$68 million in series A money Hong Kong-based Sandbox VR offers a futuristic virtual reality experience that allows groups of up to six members to see and physically interact with each other like in the real world. The company used this pitch deck to help it secure US$68 million in its series A round in 2019.

      "Article 6: Did you expect anything but more Grab news?Sign up for the Daily Newsletter, sent exclusively to our Premium subscribers. We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription. Hello readers, When scouting for players to sign on Football Manager, a simulation game that I play, my scouts will sometimes report that a player has great potential and good stats across the board but will strongly recommend against making a move for him anyway. That’s when I take a look at his character traits and see that he’s got an unambitious personality or that he struggles to perform in big matches. After all, the ability to perform under pressure can make or break a footballer’s career. Grab, after making its long-awaited public debut last week, is now facing some pressure of its own. The super app ended its first trading day with its share price down over 20%. Today’s premium article looks at what could come next for the Southeast Asian tech giant. Today, we look at: Is it up or down next for Grab’s share price? The series C round of a South Korean online lending startup Other newsy highlights such as some changes among the Alibaba bigwigs and the universal dreams of a Japanese spacetech firm Premium summary Keep on truckin’? Have you ever wanted to try something new but then stumble into a face-plant? Well, tough as it can be, all we can do is try and power through. And, of course, that’s what Grab is going to do after a middling open to its life on the public markets. The sitrep: At the end of this week, Grab will have around 29.2% of its outstanding share capital, or about US$11 billion worth of stock, available for public trading. But here’s the kicker: Another 2.6 billion shares, worth roughly US$23 billion based on recent stock prices, will be released to the public by June. Sword of Damocles? The release of the additional stock will likely put downward pressure on Grab’s market performance, analysts say. “That is huge and will act as an overhang on the stock price,” Brian Freitas, an analyst with Smartkarma, told Tech in Asia. Riding on riding: If Grab can prove that its earnings are resilient despite the challenges faced by its mobility business, that will be one driver to push its share price up in the near term.

South Korea-based online lending platform Peoplefund has raised 75.9 billion won (around US$64 million) in a series C funding round. The company claims that this is the largest amount raised by any consumer loan-focused lending platform in South Korea.

      "Article 21: Say hi to Token Issue, Tech in Asia’s crypto newsletterWelcome to Token Issue! Delivered every Friday, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories in Asia’s crypto scene and beyond. Sign up here to receive future newsletters. Hi there, Lately, crypto has become something of a hobby for me. There’s nothing quite like its intoxicating mix of tech, finance, and economics. It’s already leaving an imprint on the masses, inspiring hate and love in equal measure and serving as fertile soil for both cynical scammers and sincere technologists. Blockchain, crypto, Web3, DLT … whatever you choose to call it, this industry has become something we can’t ignore. Whether it eventually flames out or becomes the best thing since sliced bread, I want to be a part of it. I’m no engineer, so unpacking and analyzing this movement will do. This is why we’ve ramped up our crypto coverage and formed a dedicated team for it. It’s also why - after much procrastination - we’re launching this newsletter, which serves as your guide to our coverage as well as the hottest topics in crypto. Our approach is simple: We’re not here to shove Web3 down your throats. We want to cover the good, bad, and ugly of the space in language that’s accessible to non-crypto folks. For our debut issue, we’ll talk about Three Arrows Capital, the mushrooming of new Ethereum killers, and more. We’ll also discuss whether Helium, a highly touted Web3 project, is just a load of hot air. Let’s dive in. -- Terence (Note: Token Issue will be on hiatus next week, but will resume the following week.) The big story Mission impossible: Recovering 3AC’s missing assets The collapse of 3AC has left piles of digital assets for the bankruptcy court to comb through. Lawyers tell Tech in Asia that this is the first major liquidation involving massive volumes of cryptocurrencies. This means that recovering the funds will require using techniques that are still nascent. In this story, Scott Shuey unpacks the challenges involved in this monumental task and why it might turn out to be mission impossible. ⭐ To the stars A look at what’s pushing Web3 forward. How many Ethereum killers does the world need? It’s funny how Ethereum remains entrenched as the world’s no. 2 blockchain despite many attempts to unseat it. Solana, Avalanche, and BNB Chain have emerged as viable and functional alternatives that are improving all the time. And yet more Layer 1 blockchains are coming up. Aptos, a team consisting of the programmers behind Meta’s defunct Diem blockchain, has raised US$150 million to bring the project back to life. According to CoinDesk, this brings Aptos’ total haul to US$350 million. That’s a crazy amount, considering it probably hasn’t made a single cent in income. (Just another day in the crypto world, I suppose.) Why have investors like PayPal Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and yes, even the defunct Three Arrows Capital, gone gaga over this? It’s because Aptos introduces a smart contract programming language called Move, according to a blockchain coder. Move promises to improve productivity for coders by 3x to 5x compared to Solidity, Ethereum’s smart contract scripting language. Aptos isn’t the only new kid in town. Months ago, we covered the launch of Oasys, a gaming-focused blockchain backed by Japanese gaming bigwigs. Nor is Aptos the only Diem-based project around. With its Sui blockchain, Mysten Labs has recently raised an eye-popping US$200 million in funding. But Ethereum probably isn’t going away, which means its lesser rivals may become ghost towns. A bevy of scaling solutions are letting people transact cheaply on top of Ethereum. A new one to watch out for is AltLayer, which has raised funds from an enviable list of investors to build a service that lets decentralized apps boost transaction capacity on-demand. We may be entering another phase of infrastructure-building in Web3 that could in turn lead to a new wave of crypto apps. 🌙 To the moon Tokens, NFTs, and yield generators we’re noticing. 1️⃣ Orion Protocol: Having too many blockchains around can be a headache for users. Orion solves this by providing a simple interface to use decentralized finance (DeFi) services on various chains. Holders of its token, Orn, can earn a cut of the platform’s revenue. It can also be used to pay for trades at a discounted rate. 2️⃣ Solace: Solace is a DeFi insurer that automates the quotation and claims processes. By bonding it with your funds, you’ll get Solace tokens that entitle you to a share of the platform’s income. Bonding is how it raises underwriting capital. Do check out our deep dive into crypto insurance and our list of key players in the space. 🌏 Back to earth The week’s biggest roadblocks. The “prize” of regulating crypto It’s been a rough week for Coinbase, with its shares tumbling more than 10% after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) put the largest crypto exchange in the US in its crosshairs. A greater tug of war is at play, though. It seems that the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are tussling over the right to regulate crypto. Fortune is couching this as a matter of pride - whoever prevails gets the “prestigious task” and “prize” of regulating crypto. But it's a philosophical fight as well. A statement released by CFTC appears to criticize the SEC for trying to claim jurisdiction over crypto via enforcement actions. “Major questions are best addressed through a transparent process that engages the public to develop appropriate policy with expert input,” it reads. It appears that regulators across the world are far from agreeing on how to treat crypto. China has prohibited it, India wants to ban it for the umpteenth time, and the Philippines appears to be keeping its doors open. Singapore, meanwhile, is mulling adding more rules to restrict retail crypto trading, and it plans to do so “in line with international regulators.” But given the lack of consensus, all I can say is: Good luck figuring that out. Still a Ponzi scheme The latest Web3 and crypto takedowns. “Helium, often cited as one of the best examples of a web3 use case, has received US$365 million of investment led by A16z. Regular folks have also been convinced to spend US$250 million buying hotspot nodes, in the hopes of earning passive income. The result? Helium's total revenue is US$6,500 per month.” - Liron Shapira, entrepreneur Helium has basically built a decentralized network for 5G and IoT devices. The network professes to generate close to US$2 million in data credits revenue a month. Here’s the problem: People are buying its tokens thinking that Helium is seeing a lot of usage from actual network users. But it turns out the vast majority of the credits have been spent on setting up new hotspots and transferring tokens between wallets. So instead of being a proper Web3 use case, it has turned into a Web3 product searching for a use case. That’s a huge difference. Helium’s founder has since responded to the criticism. More to chew on Essential news and views. 1️⃣ Unstoppable Domains raises US$65m to reach unicorn status: Imagine owning your own web domain name as an NFT, with no renewal fees. That’s what the company promises, and you can bet NFT domain-name squatting will be a thing.

Polygon is an investor in the round. 3️⃣ South Korean prosecutors raid home of Terra co-founder Daniel Shin: Offices of crypto exchanges, as well as that of Shin’s Terra-linked fintech firm Chai, were also raided. Tech in Asia found out earlier that Terra’s highly touted partnership with Chai wasn’t all roses. 4️⃣ What the “dollar milkshake theory” means for crypto: The US dollar is sucking liquidity from the world, and that includes crypto, too. That’s all for this issue - we hope you liked it. WAGMI!\n",

LIVE EVENT Making sense of ESOPs Imagine you received two job offers from companies that you’re passionate about. Company A is a multinational corporation that offers a cushy paycheck, while company B, a fast-growing startup, offers a much lower pay that comes with something different: an employee stock option plan (ESOP). Which would you choose? For some, they might jump on the first option. But for others, the second option looks much more attractive because of the growth potential and the possibility that the startup may exit one day. Using ESOP is a popular way to supplement employees’ remuneration packages in startups while still being able to attract, motivate, and retain tech talents. But implementing ESOPs is not as easy as it seems for early-stage Southeast Asian startup founders. How exactly do you come up with a solid ESOP structure to attract and keep talents? How much equity are investors comfortable with issuing as ESOPs? What happens when your startup finally exits? We answer all these and more at Tech in Asia Live event, Decoding ESOPs in SEA, with Ravi Ravulaparthi, CEO and co-founder of Qapita. As a Core and Live subscriber, you can RSVP for free and dive into the complicated world of ESOPs and have all your questions answered today.
