On Friday I wrote that <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/microsoft-apple\">Microsoft is the new Apple</a>, and it seems like China's tech community may be thinking the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's upgraded MacBook Pro line obviously made headlines across all of China's tech news sites, but commenters seem decidedly underwhelmed by Apple's innovations this go-round. For example, one popular comment <a href=\"http://comment5.news.sina.com.cn/comment/skin/default.html?channel=kj&newsid=comos-fxxfuff6995630\">on Sina Tech</a> reads:\n",

Originally I was thinking I'd wait for the upgraded MacBook Pro, but it turns out all they \"upgraded\" was the price. It's just not worth it. Can Apple get back to the transformative way it was in the Steve Jobs era? Now it seems its attempts at change are very stiff. Like the ports. In the Jobs era, everybody was excited by the changes Apple made.

One of the most popular comments on Sina Tech reads: \"Compared to the Surface Book, this is totally unattractive.\" And over on Netease Tech, when one commenter listed some upsides of the new MacBook Pro, another commenter replied: \"I think those upsides you mentioned are all even better on the Surface.\" That reply received five times as many upvotes as the MacBook-praising comment it was responding to.\n",
