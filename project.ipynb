      "Article 1: Southeast Asia’s up-and-coming wealthtech playersWelcome to The Top Up! Delivered every Wednesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. Get it in your email inbox by registering here. Hello there, Since becoming a quarter-of-a-century-old, I’ve noticed that I can spend hours with my friends talking about how to manage our income. Many of us have started investing in stocks and crypto in order to achieve savings milestones before turning 30. However, I’ve also learned that financial management is a lifelong hustle. Whether you’re planning a wedding or looking to retire, budgeting is crucial. And with the help of tech-enabled wealth management platforms, we can do it more easily and efficiently. In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Qishin maps out notable wealthtech players in Southeast Asia and further categorizes them into digital brokerages, advisories, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and others. Singapore and Indonesia are two bright spots for wealthtech in the region, with the former seeing a 7x increase in such investments between 2017 and 2021. The enthusiasm of millennials and Gen Z - like my friends and I - for investing is one of the driving forces behind the rise of wealthtech. Meanwhile, for this week’s Hot Take, I analyze Indonesia-based Cermati and what could be powering the financial aggregator’s fast-growing valuation. – Budi THE BIG STORY Mapping Southeast Asia’s key wealthtech players Asia’s wealthtech scene is on the rise, with Singapore taking the lead in investments and deal numbers. THE HOT TAKE Why is Cermati’s valuation growing so fast? Here’s what happened: Cermati, a financial aggregator based in Indonesia, has secured over US$17 million in a series D round, DailySocial reported. The round was reportedly led by existing investor MDI Ventures, which also took the lead in Cermati’s series C fundraise in May 2021. The latest funding brings Cermati’s valuation to over US$344 million, according to VentureCap Insights. Here’s our take: It’s no secret that the pandemic was a test for companies in the travel sector. The same goes for insurtech firms, which saw sales of travel insurance plunge. GoBear in Singapore was no exception. Despite just raising funds, the firm shut down in January 2021 after a costly decision to launch its own travel insurance products. On the surface, Cermati shares a similar story with now-defunct GoBear. Both started out as financial marketplaces that compared products like credit cards before diversifying into insurance plans and loans. According to VentureCap Insights, Cermati has raised over US$58 million to date. Its post-money valuation of US$344 million is almost 10x of what it was worth in 2018. Cermati, which was founded in 2015, has not publicly confirmed these figures. See also: Behind GoBear’s surprising and sudden closure Why the huge discrepancy in valuation? What many may not realize is that Cermati has grown past its financial aggregator days and is now an all-round fintech firm. Today, it operates a holding company called the Cermati Fintech Group (CFG), which offers lending via a buy now, pay later platform that it partly owns called Indodana. CFG also has a insurtech platform. In 2019, Cermati acquired local insurance broker and consultancy Fokus Solusi Proteksi and rebranded it to Cermati Insurance. Eventually, it became Cermati Protect, which has teamed up with over 50 insurance companies to provide employee, logistics, and other types of insurance for businesses. The group has started underwriting microloan and insurance products, along with loan distribution and digital ID verification. CFG is working towards becoming a full-stack insurtech platform, which could put it in the league of traditional insurance companies. A banking-as-a-service (BaaS) offering that it launched in 2021 could also be a reason for investor optimism. The BaaS unit was launched in partnership with digital bank BCA Digital and ecommerce platform Blibli. Both are part of the conglomerate Djarum Group, a Cermati investor. The integration allows BCA Digital users to avail of banking services such as opening an account, transferring funds, and making payments through the Blibli app. It has also enabled Blibli to launch its own BNPL solution, Blibli PayLater. BaaS startups are having a moment. US-based Unit, which helps companies embed financial services into their products, raised US$100 million in May. This pushed the firm’s value to US$1.2 billion. In Asia Pacific, the BaaS industry is worth US$7 trillion, according to research by Finastra. Companies looking to migrate to BaaS solutions are also expected to grow at a rate of more than 70% per year globally. That said, it’s unclear how big Cermati’s BaaS business is relative to its loans or insurance verticals. But for now, what’s certain is that Cermati will benefit from its deep pockets and the network of major investors like Djarum. Concurring with this, Aldi Adrian Hartanto, partner at Arise, an early-stage VC fund in partnership with Telkom-backed MDI Ventures, said strategic partnerships with investors’ firms could strengthen Cermati’s value propositions. Being a \"one-stop financial solution\" for Indonesian consumers could enable vast upselling/cross-selling opportunities, he added. – Budi The Hot Take has been updated to include Hartanto’s statements.

      "Article 2: Southeast Asia’s thriving buy now, pay later players (update) This is the latest version of the article, which was previously updated on July 23, 2021. Since then, we’ve added our analysis of the latest developments in the sector as well as new players and funding rounds to the list. While news of Klarna’s valuation shakedown has sent shockwaves through the buy now, pay later industry of late, Southeast Asia-based players appear not only to be relatively unscathed, but to be thriving. This month, Tokopedia introduced GoPayLater Cicil, a flexible BNPL solution available to select users on the platform. It allows users to customize their loan limit and choose to split payments over one, three, six, or 12 months. See also: BNPL struggles amid global recession – except in Southeast Asia As of July, ShopBack, which acquired BNPL firm Hoolah last November, has officially launched ShopBack PayLater, its own native pay-later product, in Singapore and Malaysia. Meanwhile, the two-year-old Pace, which acquired competitor Rely in March, says earnings in the first quarter of this year matched that of its annual revenue in 2021. Firms in the space continue to attract funding. While the number of deals have fallen from a high in 2020, the total deal value appears to have held steady. In January, Philippines-based BillEase raised US$11 million. In July, SuperAtom, which operates pay-later platform UangMe in Indonesia, also raised US$22 million in a series C round. That’s not to say that all is rosy for all BNPL firms in the region. Earlier this year, Australia player Zip entered Singapore through a partnership with Singtel Dash but called it quits in a matter of months. In June, Zip said it would prioritize its core markets of Australia, New Zealand, and the US. See also: BNPL sours in Australia, but will SEA players buck the trend? Jungle Pay, which operates BNPL services in the Philippines, has also quietly shut its doors. A check on its site shows the firm is no longer active. Industry voices have also sounded caution on what rising interest rates, which directly impact the cost of borrowing - a key operational cost for BNPL firms - would mean for the industry. Here are a few more observations: Since 2021, Grab has expanded pay-later offerings to the Philippines, expanding beyond Singapore and Malaysia. Shopee’s pay-later service is also now available in more markets, including Singapore and the Philippines. However, the program appears to still be in testing and available only to selected users. Singapore-based OctiFi has rebranded to LatitudePay. While the firm targeted offline merchants instead of ecommerce when it started out and had been focused on items with larger ticket sizes of US$1,000 and above, it appears to have pivoted to ecommerce. It’s worth noting that LatitudePay’s expansion plans seem to be on track - it’s now in both Singapore and Malaysia. What’s next? Consolidation in the industry will likely continue. A large number of BNPL players entered the scene between 2020 and 2021. Smaller players may become acquisition targets for larger BNPL firms - with PayPal’s acquisition of Paidy, Pace’s takeover of Rely, or ShopBack’s buyout of Hoolah being examples. While pay-later products are commonly split into three to four installments, as the industry matures, operators might eventually introduce longer-dated installment payment products - i.e., those that can be repaid over six to 12 months. That’s one potential area that ShopBack is looking at, Hamish Moline, the firm’s managing director for financial services, tells Tech in Asia. While paying in three installments might make sense for clothing or fashion items, longer installments might be more relevant for items that are perceived to to have more intrinsic value. “If you buy a new pair of shoes, in two months time, you want to pay it off, so you can buy a dress. An iPhone is very different - you don’t buy another iPhone for two years,” Moline notes. Here are the details on the funding rounds that we’ve tracked: We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will become an even more useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Southeast Asia’s BNPL space.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription. Hello reader, Back in 2020, I was chatting with a VC about the development of Southeast Asia’s startup scene, and he mentioned that the lack of exits in the region was something that could potentially hold it back. Now, things have changed. We’ve seen several of the region’s tech giants, like Grab and Bukalapak, make their public market debuts over the last year. PropertyGuru started trading in New York in March, and GoTo Group - the joint Gojek-Tokopedia entity - has just listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). This doesn’t even take into account the other roads to an exit that are available to startups, such as mergers and acquisitions. All of this is a sign that Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem is maturing. The companies that paved the way are moving on to the next stage, and it’s marking a new era for the region’s tech companies. Today, we look at: The biggest exits in Southeast Asia How GoTo’s public market debut kicked off Other newsy highlights such as Tiket’s pre-IPO merger plans and China’s regulation of internet giants’ algorithms Premium summary Mark the exit Exits are a mark of a healthy startup ecosystem, and Southeast Asia has seen a fair number over the last few years. We take a closer look at some of the region’s largest exits. The big B: At the top of our list right now sits Indonesian ecommerce firm Bukalapak, which went public in 2021. The firm raised US$1.5 billion from the listing - the largest on record for Indonesia. Another B: Social media app Bigo, which focuses on livestreaming and short-form content, comes in second. The firm was acquired in 2019 by Chinese social network YY for over US$1.4 billion. This time, it starts with an L: Ecommerce major Lazada sits in third place, having been acquired by Chinese tech giant Alibaba for US$1 billion in 2016. Read more: 20 largest exits in SEA News spotlight Let’s go, GoTo! GoTo Group, the joint entity formed through the merger of Gojek and Tokopedia, has officially listed on the IDX. Its shares were up 15% on its initial price in the first hour of its trading day, putting its valuation at US$32 billion. GoTo’s stock rose almost 23% to 416 rupiah (US$0.029) apiece from its initial public offering price of 338 rupiah (US$0.024) only minutes after the market was opened. As of 4:30 pm SGT, the price stood at 382 rupiah (US$0.027) per share. The company raised roughly US$952 million in its financial debut by selling more than 40.6 billion shares, representing 3.43% of its enlarged share pool. The money raised will be split three ways - a third will go to GoTo Group, another third toward Tokopedia, and the rest for GoPay, GoFinance, and Gojek’s operations in Singapore and Vietnam. Quick bytes 1️⃣ Big Tiket plans Indonesia-based travel booking platform Tiket could merge with local ecommerce firm Blibli before going public. This comes after Tiket's plan to merge with a special purpose acquisition company fell through. The travel booking firm is now looking to raise up to US$1 billion in its IPO, but its talks with Blibli are reportedly still ongoing. The latter also has its own plans to go public. 2️⃣ China’s big tech regulation continues The Cyberspace Administration of China has said that it will conduct on-site inspections of internet firms and review their services in a move to crack down on the potential abuse of algorithms. The internet watchdog said that “large-scale websites, platforms, and products with big influence” would be targeted. 3️⃣ Enter Terra LongHash Ventures, a Singapore-based blockchain investor, has partnered with Terraform Labs to launch an accelerator that focuses on the Terra ecosystem. Also called LongHashX Cohort 8, the new program marks Terra’s first accelerator. Terra is a public blockchain protocol that looks to bring decentralized finance to the masses. In late 2019, it announced its plan to expand to Southeast Asia with Singapore as its regional hub. 4️⃣ A and G Capital A’s digital business, Airasia Super App, has partnered with Google Cloud to co-create software tools, nurture tech talent, and provide more data-driven intelligence for MSMEs. The partnership with Google Cloud will encompass four pillars, including building a Cloud Center of Excellence consisting of experts from both AirAsia and Google Cloud, as well as AirAsia tapping into Google Cloud’s infrastructure to bolster its app’s reliability as more features and services are added. 5️⃣ Here’s to elevating some startups Elevation Capital, a VC focused on seed- and early-stage startups, announced the launch of its new US$670 million fund, which it said is one of the largest for India. Formerly known as Saif Partners, the firm will continue to focus on seed and series A startups with the latest fund – its eighth so far. 6️⃣ Cohort number five EY Foundry, the virtual incubator program of multinational professional services firm EY, is now accepting applications from early-stage tech startups for its fifth cohort in Asia Pacific. The program is targeting startups with working prototypes ready for scaling, and these firms should be in their series A funding stages or earlier. Startups that can enhance EY’s tax practices in the client servicing, new enterprise, sustainability, and people and wellness spaces are also preferred.\n",

Hello reader, As a writer for Tech in Asia Studios, I spend a lot of my time conducting interviews with people for the articles we produce in partnership with brands in the tech and startup space. The fun part of this process is talking to people and hearing their stories. The not-so-fun part: reviewing the interview recording after the fact and having to transcribe the conversation to craft the piece. AI-powered transcription service Otter.ai has honestly been a lifesaver. While it’s still not the best at picking up my Singaporean accent, it saves me the pain of transcribing calls from scratch, allowing me to spend more time on stuff that actually makes a difference - like writing an awesome article. AI has the potential to really transform the way we work, but it’s also a field that requires lots of time and heavy investment for new solutions to be developed. Let’s take a look at the investors who are putting money into the space. Today we look at: The investors backing Southeast Asia’s AI startups A Pakistani B2B startup that’s just raised some funds Other newsy highlights such as Line’s plans for an NFT marketplace and Indonesia’s new rules for its internet and social media firms Premium summary All that AI money We all know that AI has the potential to completely revolutionize the way we live our lives. But who are the investors putting money behind the startups in Southeast Asia that are trying to create these revolutionary technologies? Let’s find out. Lucky seven: At the top of the list sits Wavemaker Partners, which has invested in seven AI startups in the region over the last 24 months. Companies it has invested in include Silent Eight, which uses AI to combat financial crime, and Wiz.ai, an AI-powered customer engagement platform. Six and six make a dozen: Sharing the second spot are Entrepreneur First and Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore. Between them, they’ve backed companies such as Waste Labs, 6Estates, X0PA, and Polymerize.io. Five for fighting: Antler comes in at third on the list, having backed five AI startups in Southeast Asia in the last two years. Its investments include Slab & Co, a fully automated AI-driven publishing solution for mobile apps, and StoryBrain, which uses AI to generate visuals and speed up the design process.

Startup spotlight This startup is digitalizing Pakistan’s mom and pop shops Mom and pop shops are a mainstay of life everywhere, but many of them still rely on manual processes in their operations. That’s where Pakistan-based B2B ecommerce firm Jugnu wants to make a difference. It’s just raised US$22.5 million in a series A round led by Sary, a B2B marketplace that focuses on the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan (MENAP) markets. Founded in 2019, Jugnu connects kiryana (mom and pop) stores directly to manufacturers through its app, helping address the challenges that SMEs encounter with inventory procurement. To date, the firm has onboarded more than 30,000 kiryana stores across Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad, and it is currently expanding into other cities. It has also started offering buy now, pay later services for kiryana owners. Besides receiving fresh funding, Jugnu has also entered into a partnership with Sary, a move that will pave the way for consolidation in the B2B space in MENAP and allow both companies to leverage diverse expertise and talent transfers across the region. Quick bytes 1️⃣ NFTs down the Line Messaging app Line is set to launch an NFT marketplace on April 13 in Japan. Called Line NFT, the marketplace is affiliated with 17 content firms and will sell more than 100 types of non-fungible tokens. Those who buy tokens on Line NFT can exchange them with friends who are also registered Line users, and purchases can be paid for via credit cards as well as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. 2️⃣ Eyes on the price Malaysia-based ecommerce aggregator iPrice has raised US$5 million in a round backed by Tokyo-headquartered Itochu Corporation and the KDDI Open Innovation Fund III, the VC fund of Japanese telco firm KDDI. Established in 2014, iPrice allows online users to compare product specifications, prices, and seller feedback. 3️⃣ New roads for Eight Roads Eight Roads Ventures is launching Eight Roads China Technology Fund V, with US$350 million earmarked for venture and early growth investments on enterprise tech, fintech, and consumer tech players. This is the firm’s second specialized technology fund and ninth vintage fund for Chinese businesses. Last year, it launched a US$400 million fund focusing on the healthcare sector. 4️⃣ Strict rules in Indonesian cyberspace The Indonesian government is reportedly drafting measures that will allow it to impose fines and file criminal charges against internet and social media firms. Under the new rules, tech companies must remove “unlawful” content within four hours of an “urgent” request from any Indonesian government agency. If the request isn’t urgent, companies have to comply within 24 hours. Some tech executives who are aware of the plan have said that the rules will be hard to follow and will raise operating costs. Additionally, these measures could also pose a threat to freedom of expression in the country. 5️⃣ Buying from the bigger players Singapore-based Validus, a growth financing platform for small and medium-sized businesses, has struck a deal to acquire the loan portfolio of CitiBusiness, the small banking unit of Citi Singapore, in the city-state. Validus said the deal would strengthen its top-line revenue, extend its customer base, and expand its own loan book. It would also be the first acquisition by a Southeast Asian fintech firm of an established bank’s loan portfolio and customer base. 6️⃣ Dollars for this DeFi startup Singapore-headquartered Struct Finance, a decentralized finance platform, has raised US$3.9 million in a seed round, with Antler and Arcanum Capital among its investors. The fresh funding will go toward building out tools for institutions to easily customize their interest rate products.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a Premium subscription. Hello reader, When I was in school and looking for part-time jobs during the holidays, it was pretty common to see job postings with the phrase “join with your friends” appended to them, especially for places that were looking to hire temporary staff en masse. I’ll admit, it was pretty fun to be working with friends, even if we were just doing boring things like packing goody bags for an event. Much like how I took up jobs along with my buddies, VC firms also invest alongside other investors whose interests align with theirs. There are many reasons why a firm would choose to co-invest with several others - or to not invest with someone at all - but what’s interesting is uncovering the tangled web of these connections, which is what my colleague Tian Wen did. Today we look at, The state of VC alliances in Southeast Asia in 2021 A startup that’s trying to make the morning after a night out less painful Other newsy highlights such as what the future could hold for Grab and Cars24’s entry into Southeast Asia Premium summary Hey buddy! It’s no secret that VCs invest with peers all the time. What’s interesting, though, is taking a closer look at these connections and exploring the networks that these firms have built. Here’s a look at the state of VC alliances in Southeast Asia in 2021. At the top of the leaderboard: There’s been a significant reshuffling over the past year in the top 20 most active VCs in Southeast Asia in terms of deals made, although the top five most active investors have mostly kept their previous positions. Expanding the circle: According to our analysis, the top five VC firms appear to have become less agnostic over the past year. In this timeframe, VCs have opened their doors to more co-investors and appear to be deepening relationships with new ones. Welcome to the gang: These new co-investors are a varied bunch, ranging from institutional investors to government-linked firms. However, co-investments in Southeast Asia are coming from an increasingly diverse crowd, such as Chinese corporations and VC firms like Kuaishou, ZhenFund, and Boyu Capital, as well as startups-turned-investors like Traveloka and Ovo.

The last time I had one, I spent the better part of the day lying in bed feeling very sorry for myself. That’s why some former senior executives at Grab have come together to launch Bounceback, which produces an anti-hangover pill to help folks get back up on their feet after a late night of drinking. All-natural: Launched in September this year, Bounceback’s pill is made of natural substances, with dihydromyricetin (DHM) as its “hero ingredient.” DHM helps metabolize alcohol faster by decreasing blood alcohol concentration and promoting alcohol clearance. Cash in the bank: The firm raised an undisclosed sum in a seed round from investors in September. It’s currently looking to raise another US$3 million in its pre-series A round by January 2022 to get approvals from various health regulators, complete its compliance process, build its inventory, and ramp up hiring. Some lessons from Grab: According to Bounceback co-founder Roy Ang, Grab pushed companies to build communities similar to that of its own. Bounceback has also adopted this approach by distributing its pills at concerts hosted by local disc jockeys, instead of selling them through traditional pharmacies. Quick bytes 1️⃣ The journey ahead for Grab Grab‘s first few days on the public market haven’t been the easiest, with its shares ending last week at US$7.12 apiece, which is roughly a 45.5% discount to its opening price on December 2. However, analysts see an easier road ahead for the firm, especially if its mobility segments pick up. 2️⃣ Rebel with a cause Rebel Foods, an India-based cloud kitchen unicorn, has committed US$150 million in strategic brand investments and acquisitions globally. The amount will be used in the next few quarters to scale up existing and new partnerships with over 40 Indian and international brands. Rebel Foods is currently present in 10 markets, where it operates over 4,000 cloud kitchens. 3️⃣ Battle of the used-car marketplaces? India-based used-car marketplace Cars24 is set to compete against Singapore’s Carro and Malaysia’s Carsome as it launches its operations in Indonesia in 2022, marking the start of its expansion into Southeast Asia. Cars24 will invest US$100 million to fuel its expansion plans into newer international markets, after its entry into Australia and the United Arab Emirates earlier this year. 4️⃣ Uber charts Didi exit Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said that the company is planning to sell its stake in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi. The US-based ride-hailing firm exited China in 2016 after it failed to make a breakthrough in the market and encountered fierce competition from Didi. Eventually, Uber sold its China operations to its local competitor in exchange for a stake. 5️⃣ Three-in-one, just like my coffee The Hong Kong unit of Singapore-based online classifieds giant Carousell has teamed up with app-based logistics platform GoGoX and buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm Atome to provide services to local businesses via Carousell for Business. Carousell and GoGoX have been working to provide logistics support to sellers through the latter’s GoGoVan and GoGoDelivery services, while Atome helps Carousell’s merchants offer BNPL payment to customers. 6️⃣ No FOMO about crypto Singapore-based payment firm Fomo Pay is joining the DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) by DBS Bank to enable merchants to accept payments in cryptocurrency from consumers “in a safe and risk-free manner.” Fomo Pay was granted three licences by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for its merchant acquisition, domestic money transfer, and digital payment token services in September.\n",
      "Article 9: Asia Partners’ co-founders break down the firm’s 2022 Internet ReportIn 2019, growth equity firm Asia Partners forecast that the market value of Southeast Asia's tech companies would soar by a mind-boggling US$425 billion within a decade, starting out with a total of US$86 billion at the time. Two years on, the region's tech firms are already halfway there. With a surge in the number of tech unicorns, a slate of upcoming public listings, a shrinking talent gap, and a growth in series C and D deals, Asia Partners is now revising its predictions. It now expects Southeast Asia's tech companies to add US$750 billion (or US$770 billion if you include figures from telcos) in the next 10 years. That would take their overall market value to US$1.2 trillion by 2031. Watch as Asia Partners' co-founders break down the details of its 2022 Internet Report.

      "Article 10: Asia Partners leads $65.7m round of Singapore telehealth firm Doctor AnywhereAs Covid-19 swept the world, businesses have struggled with a shortage of funding and other financial challenges, which left them with little cash on hand to weather the slowdown caused by the pandemic. However, the ensuing chaos opened up a number of tech-driven opportunities in healthcare sector. For mobile-first consumers in Southeast Asia, healthtech solutions are becoming a necessity. In the region’s six largest nations, public healthcare expenditure is expected to double to US$740 billion between 2017 and 2025, driven by strong growth in telehealth, digital therapeutics, diagnostics, remote patient monitoring, and analytics. To get ahead in the heated healthcare space, Singapore-based Doctor Anywhere has ramped up its services to build a telehealth platform that can connect a user with a health professional from a pool of 2,800 doctors within 18 seconds. Apart from providing diagnostic services, Doctor Anywhere also delivers purchased prescriptions and medical certificates to patients and provides home-based health screening and vaccinations. The company said that it has served over 1.5 million users across Southeast Asia since its launch in 2017. Doctor Anywhere's omnichannel strategy rests on several pillars including its physical clinics; Adept Healthcare, a managed-care business that was bought in 2019; and DA Marketplace, which sells insurance plans as well as health-related products and services. \"We were the first to launch an online mental health service in Southeast Asia and we maintain to have the largest provider base of psychologists and counselors on our platform,\" said Doctor Anywhere CEO Wai Mun Lim. Doctor Anywhere operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It has set aside certain funds to \"grow organically\" in Souutheast Asia, which may also involve the acquisition of certain assets, Lim told Tech in Asia. Soaring investor demand Today, Doctor Anywhere announced that it has raised US$65.7 million in its latest financing round led by Asia Partners. The company claims this is one of the largest private funding rounds raised by a healthtech firm in Southeast Asia. Existing investors including EDBI, Square Peg, IHH Healthcare, Kamet Capital, and Pavilion Capital also took part in the round, taking the total funds raised by Doctor Anywhere to over US$103.3 million. The fresh round was also backed by Novo Holdings, Philips, and OSK-SBI Venture Partners. The proceeds will be used to fuel the healthtech platform's expansion plans, develop its digital capabilities, and build a stronger management team. As part of the deal, Oliver Rippel, co-founder of Asia Partners, and Amit Kakar, head of Novo Holdings Equity Asia, will join Doctor Anywhere's board of directors. \"Since Covid-19, the whole  space has been a common interest to investors,\" said Doctor Anywhere's Lim, adding that several investors have already lined up to anchor the company's next funding round. Doctor Anywhere said it has seen a 3x surge in its revenue since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, while the number of transactions on the platform have risen by 5x. More than half of its revenue came from Singapore, followed by Thailand and Malaysia. Disruption in the healthtech space Rising demand in healthcare facilities has also led to several partnerships and tech advancements in the industry. For instance, super app Grab now offers integrated healthcare content, consultations, and medicine purchases, thanks to a collaboration with digital healthcare leader Ping An Good Doctor. See also: The key actors in Southeast Asia’s soaring healthtech space Similarly, insurance firms are also teaming up with healthtech startups to add digital solutions within their suite of services, such as Cigna and AIG’s tie-up with Doctor Anywhere, and AIA’s partnership with Holmusk. Companies such as Antler-backed Test At Home and Breathonix are aiming for medical interventions that could lead to faster and more efficient results. Recently, Test At Home completed the clinical trial of its proprietary \"lollipop-like\" swab device that helps individuals collect saliva samples for Covid-19 self-testing. Doctor Anywhere competes with Halodoc, an Indonesia-based telehealth platform that lets patients do online consultations with doctors through a mobile app. Halodoc reported 22 million monthly active users as of June 2020.\n",
      "Article 11: Asian tech players’ earnings calendar for FY 2021This is the latest version of the article that was previously published on July 14, 2021. The race to go public among tech startups is reaching a fever pitch. Dozens of startups from China, India, and Southeast Asia are firming up plans to list this year, as per the latest Tech in Asia report. While Asian startups have collectively attracted over US$90 billion from private investors through nearly 5,800 funding deals in 2020, this figure is just a fraction of the money flowing into public markets as a whole. Equity mutual funds in the US alone manage US$8.4 trillion domestically - that’s 18x the funds that venture capital manages in the country. Eyeing a share of all this cash in public markets, Asian tech players like Grab, GoTo Group (Gojek and Tokopedia’s merged entity), and Traveloka are on track for a listing. As more Asian tech firms prepare to take the plunge into public markets, we’ve put together a calendar that estimates when listed companies are likely to announce their quarterly results. The entries in the table range from recently listed startups to long-established businesses and will be regularly updated. We hope you will find this a useful resource. Here is a calendar of listed companies that will reveal their financial performance this August: While NASDAQ remains the most-preferred stock market destination, we also take a look at some of the other popular stock exchanges that companies have listed themselves in: Meanwhile, a huge chunk of listed companies are based out of China, followed by India, Singapore, and Malaysia. \n",

Hi readers, This tweet caught my eye the other day: “Founding > VC, always.” If you ask me to choose between the two, I would probably say the same. Why would I pick being a founder, you might ask? It just seems like founders have a lot more fun building startups. You don’t see investors talking about their personal growth or making celebratory announcements on LinkedIn as much as founders do, do you? Perhaps investors simply prefer to be hush-hush about such events. But we decided to make some noise today and talk about venture firms. Today we look at, The investors making the most deals in Southeast Asia A news app that raised US$60 million Other newsy highlights such as how Alibaba and Tencent are considering opening the great wall around their services and travel startup Yanolja raised US$1.7 billion PREMIUM SUMMARY The investors writing the most checks to Southeast Asian startups Here’s an interesting stat: Funding for tech startups in Southeast Asia has grown 50x from US$130 million in 2010 to US$7.7 billion in 2020. That’s a lot of money. So which firms are funding these startups? We might not have the numbers for the last decade, but we have the next best thing: a list of investors that have made the most deals in the last 24 months. 500 Startups has gone above and beyond its name, investing in more than 500 startups over the years. The US-based venture firm has made a ton of deals since 2019: Among the businesses that it backed recently are Vietnamese edtech startup Virtual Internships and investment app Infina. Wavemaker Partners is making waves and has clinched the second spot on our list.

      "Article 13: Asia Partners leads $37m raise of Singapore-based SCI EcommerceSingapore-based cross-border ecommerce enabler SCI Ecommerce said it raised over S$50 million (US$37.5 million) in a round led by Southeast Asia-focused VC firm Asia Partners. SCI, which is short for Singapore, China, Indonesia, plans to use the fresh investment to develop new software tools for its brand partners and expand its geographic capabilities for ecommerce operations and fulfillment. The funding comes after SCI more than doubled its 2019 revenues to over US$100 million in 2020, according to the company. It also said it has been EBITDA positive since 2019 and was net income-positive last year. The startup is planning of going public in the US by the end of this year and targets a valuation of US$1 billion, SCI's CEO Joseph Liu told Bloomberg. The company will also consider a secondary listing on the Singapore stock exchange. VentureCap Insights pegged the company's valuation at around US$225.8 million post-money, more than 5x its valuation of US$40.5 million after its 2019 funding round. “This fundraising round, the first large institutional equity investment in SCI’s history, is a strong endorsement of our integrated business model that serves many of the world’s most iconic consumer brands,” said SCI CEO Joseph Liu Jiannan. The startup was founded in 2014 and provides end-to-end ecommerce solutions to help brands expand into both the Southeast Asian and Chinese cross-border ecommerce markets by setting up and managing online stores. It has since grown to have offices in Singapore, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. SCI provides its services to partners such as Unilever, Abbot, Stanley Black & Decker, Crayola, and Vinda. It's also a certified ecommerce solutions provider for major online shopping platforms, including Alibaba’s Tmall, Lazada, and Shopee.\n",
      "Article 14: Southeast Asia-focused medtech firm secures $2.5m from Silicon Valley investorsGenetica, a US-based medtech startup that mainly provides its services in Southeast Asia, said it has raised US$2.5 million in its pre-series A raise, which it claims spanned only 30 days. Seasoned Silicon Valley investors such as Greylock Partners' Dave Strohm, Meritech partner and managing director Craig Sherman, and Miasnik Ventures CEO Guy Miasnik participated in the round.

      "Article 15: Asia Partners raises $384m in final close of its inaugural fund for SEA startupsSingapore-based growth equity investment firm Asia Partners announced the final close of its inaugural fund Asia Partners I LP at US$384 million in commitments. Founded in June 2019, Asia Partners aims to bridge the gap between early-stage venture capital and the public capital markets. Its investment size in startups range from US$20 million to US$100 million, which is often described as the series C or D rounds of funding. The limited partners in this new fund include institutional investors, family offices, corporations, and individual investors such as the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) from Germany. The company roped in Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher as legal advisors of the fundraise. Meanwhile, Southern Right Capital and GCA Advisors acted as placement agents. “We believe the decade ahead will be a golden age of entrepreneurship and innovation for Southeast Asia,\" said Oliver Minho Rippel, a partner at Asia Partners. The investment firm claimed that the fund is the largest debut tech fund specifically focused on Southeast Asia. Over 7% of the fund’s capital is from Asia Partners’ co-founders and its advisory board members. “We look forward to continuing our investment program and to applying our co-founding team’s and advisory board’s collective experience to helping our companies grow, both geographically and strategically,” said Nicholas Nash, the firm's managing partner and a member of its investment committee.

      "Article 16: Southeast Asia’s “buy now, pay later” battleEvery day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can sign up here. Hello readers, The number of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) advertisements I’ve seen lately in Singapore can almost rival the amount of hype surrounding Clubhouse. We have one BNPL player plastering their advertisements all over Singapore’s central district, and we have another that’s inside almost every Samsung store I enter. They definitely did their marketing right, because I’m having some kind of FOMO about not being on any BNPL platform yet. And I might not be the only one: BNPL adoption is set to grow exponentially in the coming years, and Asia Pacific is going to be a key driver. Today we look at: The who’s who in Southeast Asia’s “buy now, pay later” market The startup that raised money to make websites more accessible Other newsy highlights such as India-based digital payments startup BharatPe closing in on unicorn status and TikTok seeing hope in the US PREMIUM SUMMARY Shop 'til you drop Buy now, pay later (BNPL) is getting a lot of attention these days, attracting players including Southeast Asian super app Grab and ecommerce major Shopee to jump on the opportunity. The excitement isn’t surprising, considering how Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in BNPL adoption between 2020 to 2027. But who are the players getting all the hype? Big, but not enough: Although Grab and Shopee have joined the BNPL battle, both of them are available only in two Southeast Asian markets. Atome is leading the game with its presence in five markets, and Hoolah and Pine Lab are making plans to operate in six. The countries that are lovin’ it: According to the Tech in Asia chart, it’s clear that some markets are getting the most attention from BNPL players: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. Funding interest: Southeast Asian BNPL players are getting more attention from both investors and companies. The number of funding deals in the region’s BNPL space hit a record number last year, and Australia-based Afterpay acquired Indonesian fintech startup EmpatKali in August. Read more with charts: Southeast Asia’s biggest buy now, pay later players STARTUP SPOTLIGHT Making websites more accessible Most of us are glued to our screens every day reading news, buying online groceries, and hailing rides. But for those with disabilities, they might face difficulties doing these same actions. Web accessibility solution provider AccessiBe helps them with that, and it has recently completed its series A round of US$28 million. Backstory: Founded in 2018, AccessiBe has built a technology that scans and modifies the codes and behaviors of websites in real time to make them more accessible for people with disabilities. Achievement: The company claims that its annual recurring revenue grew by over 3.5x in the last 12 months. Future plans: AccessiBe plans to expand its US presence, continue to educate the market on the importance of accessibility, and invest in its research and development department. QUICK BYTES 1️⃣ A soon-to-be unicorn emerges India-based digital payments startup BharatPe recently raised US$108 million in a series D round at a valuation of US$900 million. But that’s not all: The company is looking to raise another US$100 million after March and an additional US$200 million in debt from banks and other institutions this year. 2️⃣ TikTok celebrates The Biden administration is putting a pause on the lawsuit over former US President Donald Trump’s ban of popular short-video app TikTok. However, the US government will still be including TikTok in a wider examination that also involves looking into the delisting of Chinese companies from US stock markets. 3️⃣ A Singtel data breach A third-party file-sharing system used by Singapore telco giant Singtel was hacked in December last year, which may have compromised customer information. Singtel is working with cyber security experts and relevant authorities, including the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, to assess the extent of the data breach. 4️⃣ Snap and ShareChat partners up The US-based social media company Snap has partnered with India’s popular social network ShareChat. The partnership will see Snap integrating its Camera Kit, which unlocks a range of augmented reality features, into ShareChat’s short-video app Moj. 5️⃣ Malaysia Boleh!

      "Article 17: Southeast Asia’s top-funded tech companies (2011-2021) Which tech company in Southeast Asia has raised the most money? It probably won't surprise you to know that the answer is Grab. Funding isn't everything, of course. While Sea is second on the list, it boasts an advantage that other players do not have: an immensely profitable gaming business called Garena. The internet giant could also raise US$1 billion within a day due to its status as a well-regarded and publicly listed company. But Grab isn't short of funds either. This speaks volumes about the company's ambitions and its goal of building a cash cushion to survive any fall. The Southeast Asian super app competes in ride-hailing, food delivery, payments, and financial services - all at once. And yet, if you split the money that it has raised so far equally among its main businesses, each of them would still make this list. All of these factors make a merger between any of these giants plausible. Only by laying down their weapons against each other can they win a war against a bigger competitor.

      "Article 18: Southeast Asia’s golden age: Resilience and recovery In 2019, we saw a presentation that, in my words, “blew us away.” Created by growth equity firm Asia Partners, the 2019 Internet Report made a bold prediction that Southeast Asia is entering a golden age, with the rise of internet companies having a big part to play in that. That day felt like ages ago. Since then, Covid-19 has ravaged the globe. Although the situation is improving in some countries, infections are still surging in many parts of Southeast Asia. It’s in this context that Asia Partners has released the latest update to its report, which takes stock of the impact of COVID and ultimately affirms the thesis that Southeast Asia is entering a golden age. It’s worth making time to sit down, grab a cuppa, and study the full report, which you can download here. Watch Asia Partners founder Nick Nash give a quick summary of the report below. To learn more about this Asia Partners' 2021 report, watch the full video here. In the meantime, here’s a quick primer on the report’s main points. Southeast Asia is still in the goldilocks zone for IPOs Asia Partners contends that countries like China, Japan, and Korea saw a similar trend: Most of their tech market value came from public listings that arose out of a time period where their per capita GDP hit a certain zone. Even though the pandemic has led to negative GDP growth in 2020, Southeast Asia still lies within the zone and will for some years to come. Local network effects reign supreme Most of the region’s winners are turning out to be firms that have strong network effects in local markets - think Sea, Grab, and Gojek. Sea, in particular, has seen its value surge five-fold to over US$100 billion within a year. Sea’s soaring numbers contribute to a historical first: the total market value of tech firms is now on par with or has even exceeded the telcos, which was a milestone China first hit in 2009. With such optimism in tech, the IPO drum beat has indeed grown louder for many of the region’s unicorns. See: “Rule of 25” is the key to startup IPOs, says Asia Partners’ Nick Nash There’s a good reason why these listings are anticipated. They would create the liquidity and returns to spur on the next wave of ventures and investments in the ecosystem, which still suffers from a series C and D funding gap. An operational blueprint for SEA giants Covid or not, it seems that remote working is bound to play an indispensable role in how the region’s tech giants operate. Singapore typically houses the C-suite, regional headquarters, and engineering centers. The CTO, sitting in Singapore, often manages staff sitting in other engineering hubs like China and India. Even Indonesia-focused companies are running regional setups, taking advantage of the talent and infrastructure found abroad. Rising to the occasion Covid-19 has been a global tragedy that has disrupted countless lives. It’s also causing permanent behavioral changes, and some startups in Asia Partners’ portfolio are seeing that first-hand. Edtech firm Snapask has seen its revenue grow 45% between April and November 2020. Online car marketplace Carsome, meanwhile, has doubled its transactions post-Covid. While international travel has been the hardest hit sector, domestic travel has been rather resilient. RedDoorz saw its net revenue hit a record-high in the fourth quarter of last year. A word of caution This optimism should be tempered by caution. For one, the US stock market is showing an unusual exuberance, with the ratio of market cap to GDP (or the Buffet Indicator) at an even higher reading than 2007, just before the global financial crisis. This indicates that the public markets may be overvalued and are due for a correction. A possible cause for this is the US Federal Reserve’s unprecedented intervention in the economy, which is driving up the size of its balance sheet. With so much uncertainty all around, Asia Partners is making the case that resiliency is the name of the game. “Almost 70% of the world’s most successful tech companies spent – and raised less than $100M – to get to cash flow breakeven,” it says in the report. Which is why rhinos - startups that use capital efficiently to breakeven - is a good bet to weather the storm. For Asia Partners, the best part is this: As opposed to unicorns, rhinos are real. ﻿\n",

Hello readers, If I had known I would be working from home for 3/4 of this year, I would have started a gaming chair business, just so I can stop ogling at US$800 chairs every week, ship myself one at cost price, and make a ton of money reselling them. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen since I’m no Doctor Strange. But we here at Tech in Asia have another superpower of our own: We’ve identified the biggest opportunities for startups and investors in Southeast Asia in the next decade. Today we look at: The key verticals that would shake up Southeast Asia in the next 10 years Gojek proclaiming that it’s generating positive gross margins Other newsy highlights such as Indonesia’s courting of Tesla for an investment and Zuoyebang’s 50 million user growth in the past year PREMIUM SUMMARY These verticals are poppin’ in Southeast Asia Southeast Asia is hot in the eyes of investors, because holy smokes: In 2019 alone, at least US$7.7 billion was invested into the region’s startups. But the big question is, what are the verticals that would come up on top in the next decade? Logistics and transportation: And it’s not just because of Gojek and Grab. This sector still remains largely inefficient with its opaque pricing, door-to-door inquiries, and spreadsheet-reliant operations. One of the few trends we highlighted in the report: Upstream logistics solutions. Ecommerce: This industry doesn’t need any introduction. I mean, just take a look at Shopee's reportedly 200 million monthly active users across the region. But aside from the typical B2C marketplaces, offline commerce, B2B commerce, and social commerce could also become huge. Content: With 655 million people in Southeast Asia who are increasingly digital and mobile-first, this industry is going to be huge. The online video industry alone in the Asia Pacific is estimated to reach US$50 billion in revenue in 2024. In the next few years, we would likely see more homegrown content and acquisitions made. Dive deeper into the five other top verticals as well as the other challenges: As Southeast Asia enters a golden age, here are the key opportunities NEWS SPOTLIGHT Gojek close to profitability? Oh, that big sexy word: profitability. After a decade, Southeast Asian ride-hailing giant Gojek is finally closing in on it. The good news: Gojek said that all its services are generating positive margins on a product basis. Gimme the numbers: The Indonesia-based super app has around 38 million monthly active users across the region. Its annualized gross transaction value also rose by 10% to hit over US$12 billion compared to the previous year. What the future holds: Gojek will focus on developing its food merchant ecosystem, which has seen an 80% increase, reaching 900,000 merchants from the previous year’s 500,000. The company will also continue to invest in technology and talent, unify its international platform, and expand to more countries.

      "Article 21: Southeast Asia’s internet economy to see marginal 5% growth this year due to Covid-19Despite the headwinds from Covid-19, Southeast Asia’s internet economy remains resilient as it's set to grow to US$105 billion by the end of 2020, increasing by 5% from US$100 billion last year, according to the latest report by Google, Temasek, Bain & Company. The e-Conomy SEA 2020 report attributes this to the rise of online users in the region. Around 400 million people or 70% of Southeast Asia's population is now online, jumping by 40 million since 2019. Covid-19 has accelerated digital consumption, with one in every three consumers trying digital services for the first time. Online education (55%), groceries (47%), and lending (44%) services benefited the most from this influx of new digital consumers. Vietnam saw the largest rise in new digital consumers, followed by Indonesia and the Philippines. The report also found that while the internet economies in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand recorded a single-digit growth of 6% to 7% from last year, Vietnam and Indonesia continued to grow at 16% and 11%, respectively. Singapore was the only country that slipped, with its digital economy dipping by 24% since 2019. The drop can be attibuted to a 70% year-on-year decline in the online travel market. Excluding this vertical, the city-state's internet economy saw over 20% growth, thanks to its strong ecommerce sector and status as a hub for startups that attract investment. Singapore witnessed 325 investment deals in the first half of 2020, with a total value of US$2.5 billion. Ecommerce and online media have seen the least impact from Covid-19, the report said. The ecommerce space saw a massive 63% growth, with its value soaring to US$62 billion this year from US$38 billion a year earlier. As such, it's now expected to be worth US$172 billion by 2025 instead of the US$150 billion estimate from last year's report. Lasting adoption of ecommerce is expected to continue across Southeast Asia as most first-time users said that they would keep making transactions online even after the pandemic. Meanwhile, online media grew by 22% to be valued at US$17 billion this year from US$14 billion in 2019. Music and video subscription as well as online gaming have seen a surge in new-user acquisition, up to 2x in some markets during the lockdown. But the report also showed that the transportation and food sector as well as online travel fell by 11% and 58%, respectively. Online travel contracted to US$14 billion in 2020 from US$34 billion in the previous year, while transportation and food went down to US$11 billion this year from US$13 billion in 2019. This clearly shows that the impact of the pandemic as people turned to ecommerce and curbed their travel, with many companies opting for remote working options. Apart from lending, digital financial services also gained more users. The lending loan book, however, remained at US$23 billion - same as last year - as the supply was affected by Covid-19. However, investment assets under management (AuM) shot up to US$21 billion, climbing by 116% from US$10 billion a year before. Remittance flows and online insurance services were also robust, hitting US$15 billion and US$2 billion, respectively. Digital payments is expected to see a 3% rise to US$620 billion by the end of this year, up from US$600 billion in 2019. It's also on track to grow by 15% to US$1.2 trillion by 2025. Though they're relatively nascent, healthtech and education tech are set to take off, fueled by the pandemic. Healthtech usage has surged 4x and retained users even post-lockdown. Investment in healthtech has been rising over years, with the deal valuation jumping from US$50 million in 2016 to US$510 million in 2019. The edtech sector saw a steep uptick, with funding tripling to US$270 million in 2019 from US$80 million in 2018. The year-on-year installations of the top five edtech apps also grew threefold during Covid-19. Across the region, there are 12 unicorns across the ecommerce, transport and food, travel, and media. With investments slowing down since 2019, most of the companies in these sectors have spoken publicly about taking the path to profitability. Meanwhile, investors are cautiously optimistic and will invest selectively going forward, shifting from businesses focused on growth metrics to startups that can generate sustainable profits.\n",
      "Article 22: Southeast Asia wants Big Tech regulated. Why?Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can sign up here. Hello readers, A startup’s top fear? New laws. Just look at how regulations imposed by Singapore in 2018 almost wiped out all bike-sharing startups (e.g., Mobike and Ofo). Similarly, Big Tech startups have enjoyed some pretty good years in Southeast Asia. But alas, that might change soon as governments in the region are increasingly looking to introduce new rules. Today, we look at the following: How greater regulatory scrutiny is coming to Southeast Asia A startup gets turbocharged to go vroom in Indonesia Other newsy highlights such as Tencent moving into Justco Singapore and revised laws for minors’ online activity in China Brace yourself, regulations are coming Big Tech loves mobile-first young consumers, and Southeast Asia is packed with a ton of them. That’s why plenty of companies are setting up base here such as TikTok parent firm ByteDance, which plans to expand its office in Singapore. But authorities are also starting to tighten the regulatory screws, which is bound to make things more challenging for tech players. Why is this happening? Governments have begun to realize that Big Tech has too much power. These firms have the personal data of their population and the reach to disseminate information and news as well as reap huge growing profits. Countries in the act: The Singapore government recently proposed changes to the country’s personal data laws. Meanwhile, Thailand took legal action against Facebook and Twitter just last month, and the ASEAN 6 countries have planned or already enforced value-added tax (VAT) on tech companies. How effective are these laws? In the case of Uber and Grab, it’s super effective. The companies had merged in Singapore two years ago and were fined a total of S$13 million for reducing competition in the country’s ride-hailing scene.

Singapore-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Ion Mobility has raised US$3.3 million to bring its smart electric motorbikes across Southeast Asia. Founded just last year, the startup aims to create more sustainable and affordable mobility alternatives for Southeast Asia’s large population of motorbike users. With the new seed funding, Ion Mobility plans to launch its first EV motorbike in Indonesia by next year while expanding its workforce and operations in Singapore, Jakarta, and Shenzhen. The market opportunity for the motorbike industry in Southeast Asia is huge - it’s expected to hit US$8.53 billion by 2023. Furthermore, it’s targeting Indonesia first: The archipelago has one of the biggest motorbike markets globally, with motorcycle sales pegged at 6.38 million units a year in 2019. Quick bytes 1️⃣ Tencent moved into JustCo Singapore After announcing last month that it plans to set up its regional hub in the city-state, the Chinese tech titan recently purchased almost 200 seats in the co-working space JustCo to establish its first office. 2️⃣ China strengthens protection of minors online The Middle Kingdom has updated itslaws to protect online users under 18 years old. One of the revised laws prohibits inducing addiction in minors, so providers of online services - including gaming, livestreaming, audio and video, and social media - will need to set up “corresponding functions” such as time and consumption limits. 3️⃣ “Made in China” must be printed The Indian government has warned Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart that sellers on their platforms must specify the country of origin on their products. This comes amid tensions between India and China following the ban of 177 Chinese apps in June as India’s efforts to cut down on Chinese-made imports. 4️⃣ Foxconn wants a piece of that EV pie The Taiwanese iPhone assembler is aiming to control up to 10% of the global market for EV platforms by 2025. Last Friday, Foxconn launched its first open platform for EV hardware and software. Called MIH, the platform is designed to cut the amount of time and resources needed to develop and produce electric cars. 5️⃣ Uber partners with SK Telecom The US ride-hailing giant has entered into a joint venture with SK Telecom - a South Korean wireless telecom operator - to ramp up its growth in the country, where it faces tough competition from local players such as Kakao’s mobility unit. Through this deal, Uber will invest over US$100 million and around US$50 million in T Map Mobility, a new entity launched by SK Telecom. 6️⃣ Burglar alert: Indonesian digital wallet loses money A digital wallet operator recently lost a huge amount of money to burglars, reported Bank Indonesia (BI), the country’s central bank. The payment system service provider wasn’t named, but BI’s senior deputy governor pointed out that this problem isn’t new.

      "Article 23: Asia’s startup scene is on the rise, but Covid-19 may choke its growth: reportAsia Pacific's startup economy is going through a \"major transition\" amid the increasing democratization of tech across the globe, a study from advisory and research firm Startup Genome and Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) suggests. According to the 2020 Global Startup Ecosystem Report, access to the tech economy is at an all-time high, as seen in the rising number of tech unicorns - startups valued at US$1 billion or higher. In 2013, when the term \"unicorn\" was popularized by Aileen Lee from CowboyVC, only four tech hubs worldwide produced firms with that valuation. Now, over 80 ecosystems have at least one startup that's worth US$1 billion. The report shows that Asia Pacific emerged as one of the major beneficiaries of this democratization, as the region has gone from having 20% of the world's top startup ecosystems in 2012 to 30% this year. There are some significant movements that can be observed in this year's top 30 global startup ecosystems. For one, Seoul and Tokyo - two R&D powerhouses - have broken into the rankings. China, meanwhile, has four cities in the top 30: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. The country only had two cities in the list three years ago. In India, Delhi joined Bangalore in the top 30, while Melbourne made it to the list as a runner-up to Sydney. This gives Singapore and Hong Kong, two markets that continue to perform well, more regional competitors. The Covid-19 pandemic, however, has presented a new set of problems that could stifle this growth. \"If we were publishing this report in December 2019, our reporting on the state of the global startup economy might have stopped there,\" the report notes. \"But the Covid-19-triggered economic crisis has hit - the worst global downturn since 1929 - and the startup economy is being severely affected by it.\" According to data from Startup Genome and GEN, the crisis hit startups hard on two fronts: capital and demand. Right now, there is a capital crunch around the world - the study found that four out of every 10 startups have only three months or fewer of capital runway. If these firms can't raise additional funding, they may collapse within that timeframe. Investors have also been more cautious this time around, leading to three out of every four startups having their fundraising process disrupted. This includes startups that already had term sheets from investors before the pandemic hit. Total VC funding has also dropped dramatically across the globe, falling by 20% in the first three months of 2020. On the demand side, the report showed that roughly 72% of startups saw their revenue drop since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the average startup seeing a 32% decline. Because of these shock waves, over 60% of startups have resorted to laying off employees or reducing salaries to compensate. These job cuts were prevalent across various functions, from direct sales and marketing to R&D and engineering. For startups to overcome and recover from this crisis, the global tech economy will need to play a crucial role, the study suggests. Citing research from Kauffman and the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the report says most of the net job creation in the economy comes from newer companies. To supplement this, governments must support startups and bail them out, similar to what they did for more traditional businesses. Startup jobs have also been cheaper for government programs to save compared to traditional small business jobs, the report noted. \"We need a new normal for economic development, where we are supporting the technology economy just as much as we were supporting traditional small businesses and traditional industries like airlines,\" the report urges. \"Ecosystems need to invest now to not lose the progress made in the past 10 years.\"\n",
      "Article 24: Asia a ‘high priority’ for Revolut following mammoth $500m fundraiseRevolut, one of the world’s highest-valued financial technology startups with a valuation of US$5.5 billion, has its eyes on Asia. Following the US$500 million it raised from a series D funding round in February, the London-based startup recently opened remittance routes to India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Revolut says it has over 10 million users worldwide and more than 60,000 users in Singapore. “The goal is to build a global financial network and Asian countries are critical nodes of that network,” Eddie Lee, Revolut’s Asia-Pacific regional director of operations, tells Tech in Asia. The company’s suite of financial solutions include cross-border remittances at mid-market exchange rates, peer-to-peer money transfers, and insurance as well as savings and budgeting tools. It also allows commission-free stock trading in the UK. While the startup hopes to expand its services on a larger scale worldwide, navigating the varying dynamics and regulations across regions - even within Asia itself - pose a challenge. Revolut’s current product features in Europe, however, can shed light on what Asian users can expect in future. The company didn’t specify how much it has earmarked for its expansion plans in Asia but said the region is a “very high” priority. At present, it has offices in Singapore, Tokyo, and Melbourne. Rebranding from a travel card In Singapore, over 30% of Revolut’s user transactions come from shopping and groceries, followed by spending on restaurant and dining at 24%. The startup revenue-shares an interchange fee with Visa, which is charged to merchants on every transaction made via the Revolut card or app. It also offers annual subscription plans of S$99 (US$70) for Premium accounts and S$199 (US$140) for Metal accounts, which provide customers with perks such as discounts on airport lounge access, complimentary travel insurance, and unlimited quotas on foreign exchange transactions. Revenue from its premium subscription plans climbed 154% last year, according to numbers the company released during its latest fundraise. As governments impose sweeping lockdowns and travel restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19, travel activity worldwide has slumped. The pandemic has hastened Revolut's rebrand away from being solely a travel card. “One of the challenges we see is that consumers still view us as a travel product, and we need to change that,” Lee points out. But Revolut’s business, which is still hugely dependent on users’ cross-border transactions and spending activities, hasn’t seen a significant impact from the Covid-19 pandemic. “Thankfully, we’re not going down, but we’re not growing at the pace that we see ourselves growing,” Lee adds. A finance super app Lee, who previously led Uber and then UberEats’ operations in Asia Pacific, says that gaining the trust of users is more difficult for fintech firms than it is for ride-hailing or food delivery companies. “People are very value-conscious,” Lee observes. And while for most businesses, that plays out in a straightforward price comparison, “it doesn’t work that way in finance,” he adds. Given that, building an enduring business built on trust is a priority for Revolut, and its newly launched currency routes are part of that approach. “We know there's a big Indian community in Singapore and a big Filipino community in Singapore and in Japan. So we want to be able to serve the customers here who want access to these things  are currently being charged a large fee,” Lee explains. Since 2015, Revolut has been operating without a full banking license in the UK, where its partnerships with local banks allows it to issue bank accounts to users. The company may be pursuing a similar strategy in Singapore, where it's opted not to apply for a digital banking license in Singapore last year, citing the high capital requirements - S$1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) - for a full one. “We ultimately cannot provide everything because finance is too broad and the needs are too niche. We really need partners to be successful in every country that we operate in Asia,” Lee notes. A global financial network Revolut is going up against tough competition in the space. TransferWise’s recent partnership with Alipay is a huge step for the London-based fintech company into the Chinese market, where inbound remittances were projected to hit US$70.3 billion last year, according to World Bank data. In Southeast Asia, TransferWise has inked partnerships with multiple local e-wallet operators including Ant Financial-backed GCash and Dana, Gojek’s Go-Pay, and Grab partner Ovo. This comes as Revolut continues to beta-test its product across a few markets in Asia Pacific, including Japan and in Australia. So far, it only operates in Singapore, but reports suggest that it could be rolling out in Japan in the coming months. Lee shares that Hong Kong and India, where the startup is looking to hire new talent, might be Revolut’s next Asian markets, but he declined to reveal when those launches will be. “We are building an infrastructure, not just in Southeast Asia, not just in Singapore, but across the world,” Lee says. “And we hope the infrastructure we build creates sustained differentiation that our customers can access -  that not many other players can offer.”\n",
      "Article 25: Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem has a lot of heart ❤️So far, 2020 has completely upended plans big and small. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in these uncertain times. Just this week, my colleagues and I spent less than six hours in Myanmar before we were suddenly called back due to new travel restrictions, laying waste to months of careful preparations. However, there are also many glimmers of hope amid the chaos that renew my confidence in our community. We have seen incredible gestures, such as Jack Ma’s donation to help the US and Europe fight their worsening Covid-19 situation or education tech startups such as Ruangguru, Quipper, Zenius, and Byju's making their platform free to help students who are quarantined at home. Here in Singapore, Razer has begun converting manufacturing lines so they can produce surgical masks intended for donation to other countries. Many such stories abound and strengthen a core belief about our community: Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem has a lot of heart. ❤️ It sounds simple, but we should not take it for granted. The tech revolution in Silicon Valley began with idealistic visions of using technology to meaningfully improve lives. But we have seen mission drift over the years as startups focused on products to make things more convenient, solve a niche consumer need, or merely get acquired and cash out. But the original tech vision is very much alive and well in Southeast Asia. In conversation after conversation, our region's founders and tech leaders have placed the notion of “building companies to serve their communities” at the center of their mission. When it’s business as usual, this means assisting merchants in accessing new markets, helping small businesses get paid more transparently and in a timely manner, or fostering the next generation of tech talent. In these extraordinary circumstances, a mission-driven approach can help guide the way. This year will be a test of resilience as many startups will deal with missed revenue targets, diminishing runways, layoffs, and down-rounds for the first time. Crises are key times for companies to innovate, develop creative solutions, and go after the thing that they were previously too scared to try. Difficult situations are also opportunities for businesses to go back to fundamentals they may have let slip. So refocus on your mission, build products that people love and need, practice good business sense (watch that burn!), and act with empathy towards your customers, employees, and community. Mission and heart cannot replace sound business practices, but when paired together, they can lead to innovations that can help you move past these dark times. Southeast Asia already has a head start, thanks to our strong core values. Let’s use this fertile ground to create generation-defining tech platforms, products, and services. I know it’s been a rough start to the new decade, but I see this period as a chance to reset for the next few years. And beyond this pandemic, well, we still have a lot of work to do.\n",
      "Article 26: Asian startups in state of tension amid coronavirus pandemic: Tech in Asia surveyAsian startups are becoming increasingly worried as the Covid-19 outbreak starts to negatively affect their businesses, according to a recent Tech in Asia survey of over 140 industry professionals and founders. About 80% of those surveyed said their businesses have been negatively influenced by the pandemic, which Sequoia Capital described as a black swan event that could trigger a prolonged global economic slowdown. Three in 10 respondents said they were heavily and severely hit by the outbreak. With more than 70% of the startups canceling business trips to minimize the spread of the virus, companies in the travel industry were the most severely affected. A Singapore-based travel agency said the company had already lost more than US$20 million in potential revenue due to booking cancellations. “We acquire hotels by paying a fixed amount every month,” a company executive said. “Now, we still have to pay monthly, yet we have no bookings. We have to break contract with our hotel partners. We can't pay them anymore.” The spike in infections has drawn parallelisms between the new disease and SARS, with some experts suggesting that the global economic cost of the outbreak would be much more severe compared to the latter. The potential economic fallout was amplified when the Federal Reserve recently slashed interest rates by 50 basis points - the biggest cut since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008 - amid mounting concerns that the novel coronavirus outbreak would stall the record expansion of the US economy. If Covid-19 continues to spread, the world may again be heading for another crisis of epic proportions. With much of China in lockdown to contain the virus from further spreading, the global supply chain has been significantly disrupted. As a result, some companies (about 27% of survey respondents) are looking for alternative suppliers outside of the mainland. Companies are right to prepare for the worst. Indeed, some are attempting to conserve as much cash by holding back expansion plans and slowing down hiring efforts. This makes sense considering that 40% of the startups Tech in Asia surveyed were seeing delays in fundraising activities. It pays to be nimble and flexible during these uncertain times, when companies are already reporting losses in potential revenue. As the situation appears to worsen every day, nations should be counting on their governments to come to the rescue. Unfortunately 68% of Asian startups do not trust their governments’ ability to manage the outbreak. While such skepticism is understandable, it’s also not healthy. Life must go on. Eventually, things will be back to normal, and we might even see a big surge in economic activity just like what happened post-SARS. You can find the full survey results below: \n",
      "Article 27: Asian tech deals slow as novel coronavirus epidemic spreadsWhen China sneezes, the world catches the cold. The ill effects of Covid-19 – the disease caused by the novel coronavirus identified last year in Wuhan, China – is spreading like wildfire across industries. So far, it has triggered a slump in the travel sector and disrupted the manufacturing supply chain, causing gadget makers such as Apple to downgrade earnings outlooks. And with funding for Asian technology startups in January down 52% year over year, venture capital firms fear dealmaking will further slow down. With much of China in lockdown to contain the continued spread of Covid-19, deals in the mainland saw a massive decline last month. Despite this, the outbreak’s full impact remains to be seen, as the deals that were reported in January had already been sealed weeks earlier. While some VCs such as East Ventures have yet to see much effect on their portfolio, others - including Silicon Valley-based Patamar Capital and MDI Ventures - are seeing delays in fundraising activities. “If the fund or startup only has money left for three weeks, then this will impact fundraising or company operations,” says Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner at East Ventures. “Our startups don’t have this issue.” The firm’s limited partners (LPs), he adds, are long-term partners, which makes travel for face-to-face meetings unnecessary. Disclosure: East Ventures is an investor in Tech in Asia. Patamar Capital, on the other hand, says it might have to extend the timeline for its ongoing fundraising due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. “We are talking to some investors who are not based in Asia, and because there are travel advisories, there have been some delays,” says Dondi Hananto, a Jakarta-based partner at Patamar Capital. “We will probably stretch it to the end of the year, but hopefully we can close it before that.” Aldi Hartanto, the vice president of investments at MDI Ventures, says that fundraising efforts from LPs have also slowed. “Our main country destinations for the  roadshow are China, Japan, and South Korea, which have been quite exposed by coronavirus,” he says. The firm plans to mitigate the impact of the outbreak by targeting LPs in Singapore and Indonesia, while South Korea and other markets will be covered by co-general partners based in those areas. Hartanto suggests that LP fundraising, along with investments in regional startups and growth-stage rounds, are the activities most affected, as they rely more heavily on global capital. Most VCs, he says, are limiting international travel, while saving face-to-face meetings or office visits only for final decisions (everything else is done mostly via phone or video calls). “ makes it difficult to close a deal due to face-to-face meetings being a ‘key art’ to build trust and comfort during fundraising,” he says. Some VCs have even decided not to meet a portfolio company’s founder in person at all prior to making an investment decision or shifting their investment focus to the local market, adds Hartanto. Similarly, Cuaca says East Ventures has a business continuity plan in place, which it triggered two weeks before Singapore raised its outbreak response level to code orange. In the plan, the firm leverages on cloud infrastructure and video calls for most meetings - should there be a physical meeting, no two decision makers will be in the same room to decrease redundancy. “As a seed investor, the only difference is that you must close the deal without meeting face-to-face,” he says. “But we have been well trained to read founders by their voices on a phone call or 2D impression on video call.” Other than fundraising, startup investments can also be affected. Some VC firms could have team members who are under lockdown in virus-hit countries, which makes it difficult to source and close deals. Several tech conferences and events, such as Money 20/20 Asia in Singapore, have also been cancelled or rescheduled. Some VCs may rely on such events for networking and as a deal-sourcing strategy. Fortunately for MDI Ventures, it relies more on guerilla referrals, Hartanto says. Other than Indonesia, it also has offices in Singapore and the US which can cover their investments there. That said, the Covid-19 outbreak does limit coverage in Vietnam, Hong Kong, and India, where the firm has “sizable inbound interests” but without local teams. Eng Seet, the head of Indonesia at Openspace Ventures, agrees that deal flow has not changed much, though he finds that heading into 2020, risk appetite among investors has been “shaky.” The outbreak has just made things more uncertain. What’s more critical now, Eng says, is to help portfolio companies deal with the situation. While growth may stall at the moment, smaller startups won’t be as affected from a macroeconomic sense in the same way bigger unicorns or corporations will be. There just needs to be more planning, particularly in cash management and “calculated” growth - basically, taking a “cautiously optimistic” approach, he says. “It is very important for companies to revisit their growth strategy in light of the macro headwinds we are experiencing this year. In addition, founders should continuously stress test their budget planning and be a lot more disciplined in driving growth in a capital-efficient manner,” says Eng. But ultimately, it is uncertain times like these that can help normalize lofty valuations, says the VC. “Despite the negative headwinds, it is also the best time for value investing, in which pricing becomes more normalized, relative to expectations.”\n",
      "Article 28: Asia tech funding was down 52% in January 2020 ABOUT Asia's tech funding in January 2020 plunged by 52% compared to the same period in 2019. China saw massive cuts, with funding just 30% of the year before. Southeast Asia is affected too, with Singapore and Indonesia falling out of the top five. A bright spot is India, which saw 50% growth from the preceding year. The country no doubt has the second-most robust tech ecosystem after China. While late-stage funding has been hit, early-stage funding has scaled down as well, indicating that the bubble may be bursting across both startups and mature tech firms. WHY IT MATTERS We might be seeing a severe reduction of dumb capital. Of course, one caveat is that it's hard to extrapolate too much from one month's worth of data. But January's trends seem to echo what we observed last quarter. Late-stage funding is down as a result of WeWork, and that could have knock-on effects on earlier-stage capital. Investors have become more cautious and are preaching sustainable growth. Is the novel coronavirus dampening dealmaking? Probably not in January, as deals reported in the media during that period had been sealed weeks earlier. We may get a better indication in the coming months.

      "Article 29: Asia Partners reportedly raises $118m for debut fundSingapore-based private equity firm Asia Partners has completed a second close of its debut fund at nearly US$118 million, DealStreetAsia reported, citing the company's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Tech in Asia reached out to Asia Partners, but the company declined to comment on the fundraise \"due to regulatory considerations.\" It was reported last year that the company saw the first close of its debut fund at around US$78 million. A source said at the time that it was targeting to raise over US$300 million for the fund. Asia Partners was established in June 2019 by former Sea Group exec Nick Nash, along with Oliver Minho Rippel, Pitra Ciputra Harun, Kien Nguyen, and Brook Supanusonti to focus on tech investments in Southeast Asia. The company focuses on investing in US$20 million to US$100 million rounds in the region. “We are deeply focused on solving the series C/D gap here in Southeast Asia. Companies at that stage of development are well beyond establishing product-market fit and are already making meaningful strides in their geographic expansion. They are also close to achieving profitability,\" Supanusonti said in an emailed statement to Tech in Asia. Asia Partners made its first investment last year by pouring US$70 million in the series C funding round of budget hotel chain RedDoorz. Late last year, Nash said that the fund is looking for \"rhinos,\" or humble startups that are \"worth US$1 billion in price-to-earnings multiple,\" rather than unicorns.\n",
      "Article 30: Asia’s richest man takes on world’s wealthiest to rule over India’s ecommerce sceneIndia is the world’s fastest-growing ecommerce market, making it a fertile battleground for two of the world’s wealthiest men: Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of US tech giant Amazon, and Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of homegrown conglomerate Reliance Industries. Ecommerce transactions are expected to hit US$150 billion by 2022 from an estimated US$84 billion this year, according to projections by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Nasscom, an Indian software industry body. Ambani is betting on two subsidiaries - telecommunications-focused Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail - to underpin the ambitions of his company’s new ecommerce venture, JioMart. He plans to modernize kirana shops, or neighborhood mom and pop businesses that form the backbone of commerce in India. The JioMart app allows consumers to buy groceries from kirana stores. To help kirana owners, Reliance plans to digitally connect their shops to producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands, and shoppers via an internet-enabled, handheld point-of-sale device. Telecom powerhouse In a little over three years of commercial operations, Jio is India’s second-largest telco by number of users. It launched in beta mode in late December 2015 and now has over 360 million mobile users. With most of India’s consumers using their mobile phones to buy online, this will likely give Reliance a leg up against Amazon, according to some analysts. JioMart is expected to evolve into a pan-India, mobile-first rollout. It’s designed to complement the extensive reach of Reliance Retail. Touted as India’s biggest retailer in terms of revenue, Reliance has 10,901 brick-and-mortar stores in over 6,700 Indian cities, which collectively take up around 24.5 million square feet of space. Amazon’s playbook Reliance is essentially taking a leaf from Amazon’s playbook and scaling it up. The US tech giant actually started tapping kirana businesses five years ago. It now works with around 23,000 of them to offer last-mile deliveries, Amazon India spokesperson Madhavi Kochar tells Tech in Asia. The challenge from Reliance comes as Amazon steps up investments in the South Asian nation while its growth in key markets is slowing. Operating income in North America dropped 37% year-on-year despite a 24% jump in sales in the third quarter of 2019. The company’s international operations remained in the red even as sales climbed 21%. But the Seattle-based tech giant isn’t taking this sitting down. Bezos visited India on January 14 and promised to spend US$1 billion over the next five years to help digitize small and medium-sized businesses across the country. Just landed in India and spent a beautiful afternoon paying my respects to someone who truly changed the world. “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\" - Mahatma Gandhi. pic.twitter.com/xDXAT9cBgf— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) January 14, 2020 The announcement was made even as Amazon and rival Walmart face antitrust investigations. This month, Amazon teamed up with Future Retail, India’s second-largest retailer. Under the partnership, Future Retail will put some of its inventory on Amazon’s website. It will also help deliver to Amazon Prime customers in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad within two hours, the two companies said in a joint statement. Margin pressure By speeding up deliveries, Amazon hopes to win over demanding and value-conscious Indian customers. Such strategy could hurt margins and limit opportunities to increase prices at ecommerce firms that pay for delivery. Amazon has also been managing logistics costs. It currently pays vendors about 38 US cents on average for last-mile delivery in Mumbai, down from 49 US cents previously, says a delivery vendor who asked not to be named. Vendors pick up goods from Amazon’s 50 fulfilment centers across India and deliver them to homes of Prime customers. That’s still a high cost to bear on wafer-thin margins. A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work, says Amit Sharma, co-founder of ShopX, a five-year-old startup whose app allows 146,000 retailers to order supplies from distributors, vendors, and manufacturers. About half of ShopX’s customers are kirana shops, and the company helps them curate options for fast-moving consumer goods stock keeping units (SKUs) to about 250 from an average of 2,500, Sharma says. As a result, customers can browse products quickly and ShopX can localize supplies for many of its customers. “The demands change dramatically from street to street,” Sharma observes, adding that big companies may find it challenging to adapt so quickly to such dynamics. But as more consumers become tech-savvy, kirana shop owners will be compelled to collaborate with ecommerce giants or they risk becoming obsolete, Anil Talreja, a partner at Deloitte India, tells Tech in Asia. With education levels rising, it would be easier for the younger generation of kirana operators to adopt technology, says Talreja. Big data Jio is crucial to Ambani’s ambitions. To sign up for its service, people have to use a unique, government-issued 12-digit identification number. That information, along with the mobile network’s access to real-time location, could deepen Reliance’s understanding of its customers’ needs. Such insights propelled Singapore-based Near to become Southeast Asia’s most valuable marketing tech startup. The combined data from Jio and JioMart could enable Reliance to tap big-data analytics to understand consumer preferences across India, enabling the group to make customized product offerings. Reliance is also working to gain insights into consumer spending and personal finance. It has recently collaborated with State Bank of India - the country’s largest - to provide banking services. Reliance also plans to distribute mutual funds and other investment products. A seamless payments system can help ecommerce players entrench consumers within their platforms. Amazon shoppers, for instance, are increasingly using its mobile wallet app, the company said. Having a good grasp of consumer preferences and their spending habits was also instrumental in turning Alibaba Group into one of the world’s most valuable companies. It has broken sales records while leveraging its e-wallet services. “I won’t be too surprised if they want to go the Alibaba way,” notes Siddharth Singh, an associate professor of marketing at the Indian School of Business. If that happens, Reliance could very well pull off a major coup in Indian retail, he says.\n"
