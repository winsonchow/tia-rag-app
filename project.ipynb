      "Article 1: Behind Honestbee’s big offline move and rapid expansion to 1,000 employeesIs there a sustainable business behind Honestbee's rapid rise? What will it do next? Honestbee is an intriguing startup. From just 55 staff in its small but tasteful office in Singapore's Little India in 2015, the company has grown into a 1,000-strong regional player in food and groceries delivery as well as logistics. It has just opened an Instagrammable retail and food concept space called Habitat, filled with gourmet ingredients and cooked food - a foodie's heaven. Honestbee parachuted right into the thick of Southeast Asia's online groceries wars. The company at the epicenter was RedMart, then the toast of the startup scene. Its investors were a who's who of the tech industry: Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Sea, and East Ventures, just to name a few. Then came this mysterious new player with a vastly different approach. While RedMart preached end-to-end integration from the buying experience to supply chain management, Honestbee was asset-light: Its worker \"bees\" would shop on the consumer’s behalf and then deliver the goods to their doorstep. RedMart would disrupt supermarkets - but Honestbee would help them. Then things went topsy-turvy. RedMart, running low on funds and vastly unprofitable, got snapped up by Lazada. Today, Honestbee plods along as an independent player, though it has snagged at least one major investor in recent years. Its business is multifaceted. It does on-demand delivery of food, groceries, and laundry, supported by its own logistics business, Goodship. Honestbee doesn't appear to be dominating any category, if app store rankings are an indicator. In food delivery in Southeast Asia, it's right in the mix with Foodpanda, GrabFood, and Deliveroo. In groceries, RedMart is still going strong in Singapore, and Amazon Prime is hanging in there despite being quiet. On the surface, Honestbee is the antithesis of a common wisdom about what startups should be. In an interview I did with Eric Gnock Fah, who took his activities booking startup Klook to a billion-dollar valuation, he harped on the importance of focus: In the era of “super apps” (think Facebook, WeChat, Grab, and Go-Jek), Gnock Fah thinks startups shouldn’t be concerned with becoming one themselves. Instead of catering to many user needs, focus on being great at addressing one, he suggests. He points out that even super apps start out focused. Grab was focused on ride-hailing, WeChat was focused on messaging, and Google was focused on searching. It’s only when a startup gets much bigger that diversification matters. That’s when it can hire a team with the personalities and skill sets needed for a specific new product. “For someone who’s ecommerce-driven, it’s hard to change the DNA and say, you’ll now build a social app,” says Gnock Fah. Honestbee's operations seem to have grown far more complex since its beginnings - hence the ballooning headcount. It's no longer as asset-light as it used to be: it's now running its own warehouses, a logistics service, an e-wallet, three types of deliveries, and a retail space. Acknowledging the shortfalls of an asset-light approach, it has invested in infrastructure. RedMart co-founder Roger Egan's comments seem prescient: “Picking and packing from a physical store can never be as efficient as a fully automated fulfillment center. It’ll always cost more per pick. It’s good for lowering delivery time and for convenience. But once you have to scale up, it’s not as efficient because physical retail space is more expensive and has less throughput.” Besides, the concept of getting runners to do your shopping is not new. Egan pointed out the example of Tesco – one of the largest retailers in the world. “They’ve already gone through the cycle where they used to pick from the store. They ran into a few problems. Once the penetration increased – and it’s the highest in the UK – the replenishment of the shelves was an hourly problem. They weren’t able to keep things in stock. The online pickers in the store were also disrupting the experience for the regular store shoppers,” said Egan. Habitat reflects Honestbee's diverse interests. It's a hive of activity. There’s a supermarket, food stalls, a bar, a pasta-making area, hydroponics farm, and even an art gallery. Hidden from public view is a warehouse stocking additional goods and a commercial kitchen that cooks dishes that get sent out via Honestbee's food-delivery service. Even its app could be intimidating for a first-time user because of the number of features and services available. An untested space The idea of \"new retail\" - where physical stores are interwoven with technology to improve customer experience - is fairly new and unproven. In an interview with Tech in Asia, Honestbee co-founder Jonathan Low declined to reveal financial or user metrics. But it's safe to assume that, like any startup, it's growing but unprofitable. Neither the food delivery nor groceries components of Honestbee's business are proven. Instacart, a US startup taking an asset-light approach to grocery delivery, has achieved gross margin profitability, but that's only after reaching an estimated US$2 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, Deliveroo, valued at close to US$2 billion, is seeing a gross margin of just 0.7 percent. As for Amazon and Alibaba, their efforts in this space have only just begun, though the Chinese giant is sprinting ahead and opening stores by the dozen. In Southeast Asia, the jury is still out on many ecommerce ventures, let alone the integration of online and offline retail. Shopee is unprofitable, and so is Carousell. Lazada isn't focused on profits. But they're all banking on Southeast Asia growing to a size that will justify their lofty valuations. \"The irony is that there is really nothing new in new retail,\" said Sheji Ho, group chief marketing officer at aCommerce. \"Ecommerce companies in China are going into new retail because the ecommerce growth itself is slowing there. Beyond expanding into Southeast Asia, new retail is a way for ecommerce companies to grow their market by tapping into the remaining 80 percent of the retail market which still happens offline.\" He added, \"It’s too early for startups to approach the space. New retail, at its core, is marketplaces bringing offline merchants onto their platforms so the former can control the users and data. All the QR code scanning and AR  stuff are just - no pun intended - window dressing.\" Honestbee's Low acknowledges that it's premature to put a dollar value to the benefits that Habitat will provide to the company and its partners. All that still needs to be tested, though Habitat looks like it's an expensive experiment. Yet he cited an immediate synergy: Produce from the supermarket that’s nearing its expiry date is sent to the kitchen to be cooked as part of a dish. This practice has reduced wastage. A singular focus on its partners The company has been emphasizing its mission of helping its partners - whether it's the “bees” who are working at its warehouse or delivering food to a customer, or business owners and retailers who feel threatened by the ecommerce onslaught. That's the common theme that connects its disparate threads. Ultimately, as Low told me, Habitat is a reflection of its desire to overcome the limitations it faced when partnering with traditional retailers. The space is Honestbee's wonderland. More than a place to test new concepts, it's a utopian vision and showcase of what a high-tech, ecommerce-ready supermarket should look like. \"When we work with our partners, we always envision how it could be done better. But generally, a lot of these brick-and-mortar stalls have already made investments in existing infrastructure,\" he says. In order to help retailers adopt technology, Honestbee concluded that it has to run its own store first to better understand its partners, and then create and test solutions they'll actually find useful. Habitat may not be the last physical store for Honestbee. It's looking into setting up shops in the rest of Asia. It's also thinking about spreading some of its in-house, in-store technology - the inventory management system, the point-of-sale system, and so on - to retailers and supermarkets. This could open up a new revenue stream for Honestbee. Critical to Honestbee's success may be the fact that the ecommerce scene in Southeast Asia is still a “Wild West.” The game is wide open: there really isn't a dominant player in the region that occupies every niche. And even if Alibaba - which also has an interest in the well-being of small-business owners - decides to bring its Hema supermarket chain out of China, the region is by no means a winner-takes-all market. Nor will victory for tech giants be assured when they expand. Just look at Amazon Prime, which has barely cracked the top 10 app rankings in Singapore for the shopping category. There's also a chance that Alibaba will take the acquisition route when it expands its physical retail presence in Southeast Asia, and Honestbee may be an attractive target by then. It's a question of timing - how soon will Alibaba make the move, and will Honestbee be big enough, or last long enough, to see a fat payout? For Honestbee, it'll need to achieve enough high-volume sales to succeed as well as make concrete gains from the theoretical synergies between brick-and-mortar business and ecommerce.\n",
      "Article 2: Singapore’s Honestbee to launch food delivery. It’ll get lots of competition Honestbee, a Singapore-based startup which started out as a grocery delivery service, now wants to send you lunch too. This move comes just a few months after it launched an on-demand laundry service. Announced via Facebook, the upcoming launch of meal deliveries, a feature which is currently being tested, puts Honestbee in a hyper-competitive space in Singapore filled with established players like UberEats, Deliveroo, and Foodpanda, as well as fledgling startups like Grain and DishDash. But that's just the start, an Honestbee spokesperson tells Tech in Asia. Its grand plan: to build a delivery network which enables freelance riders to fulfill an assortment of services. On the iOS app, users can now get health as well as home and auto products delivered to their doorsteps. These additional product categories are still undergoing early trials. Because it serves as a layer between services and consumers, it'll need to build up a huge volume of deliveries to make up for its thin margins. To that end, it has expanded its grocery service to eight countries in just 1.5 years. It's a trajectory the company has been on since \"day one,\" adds the spokesperson. Honestbee declined to reveal exact numbers about its performance, but says it has full-time 300 staff and \"12,500 registered delivery drivers and shoppers partners.\" Food deliveries could pair well with groceries, because in Singapore restaurants are often located near supermarkets in the same shopping malls. This move could increase the efficiency of its delivery network. Honestbee says that its food delivery service is \"not much different\" from competitors, but aims to stand out by offering consumers a wide range of conveniences beyond cooked food. Redmart, which got acquired by Lazada, is Honestbee's chief competitor in online groceries. Update on Feb 7, 5.30pm SGT: Added Honestbee's response.\n",
      "Article 3: Ex-Honestbee, Foodpanda exec’s new cloud kitchen startup banks $1.2m in seed fundingMore than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, Taiwan's food and beverage industry continues to be pummeled as the island presses on in implementing measures to curb the virus' spread. However, a study from The Business Research Company expects the global F&B market to grow from almost US$2.8 trillion in 2020 - 47% of which came from the Asia Pacific - to about US$3.3 trillion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 18.5%. Victor Chow, a past executive at food delivery platforms Honestbee and Foodpanda, believes that this recovery can also be found in the clouds. With his new startup, 3 Square, Chow looks to help F&B operators by providing local businesses with cloud kitchen solutions, including digital food hall networks. Now, the company said it has secured US$1.2 million in an oversubscribed seed round from local department store chain Hanshin and foodtech VC firm Foodland Ventures to scale its business in Taiwan and enter more markets in Southeast Asia and North Asia. \"With Covid-19 leading to the closure of restaurants and bars, many restaurant owners are looking for an alternative to the traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant business model in order to cope with the significant shift in consumer demand from dine in to delivery,\" he said. 3 Square's first location can be found in the center of Taipei City, with twenty restaurant brands available for delivery, takeaway, and dine in. Popular restaurant partners include new brands from the Michelin-starred Mume Group and 30-year-old night market standout Shi Yuan Taiwanese Fried Chicken. The startup also has a virtual restaurant group with six in-house brands. According to the company, it's now preparing for its next round of funding to help fuel the expansion of 300 brands in the 3 Square ecosystem across the region.\n",
      "Article 4: Brief: Honestbee launches Goodship logistics service in Thailand The news: Singapore-based online food and shopping delivery company Honestbee announced the launch of its logistics service, Honestbee Goodship, in Bangkok today. In Thailand, Goodship - which is already available in Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines - will initially focus on “last-mile” same-day or next-day ecommerce deliveries. It eventually aims to provide on-demand delivery in under an hour. Honestbee said that Goodship - which it has been trialling in the Thai capital for several months - has already surpassed its food and grocery services in volume. It's targeting 50,000-plus orders per day during the next 12 months. Why it matters: Asia's third-party logistics provider (3PL) market has been heating up, with companies leveraging tech like smart routing, customer tracking, and real-time fleet management to make shipping faster and more efficient. Rapid growth of the region’s ecommerce market and the entry of Amazon present potentially lucrative opportunities for “last mile”-focused 3PLs. Goodship competitors include Singapore’s Ninja Van - which entered Thailand last month and is reportedly in the midst of raising US$60 million in series C funding - and Hong Kong unicorn Gogovan, which hit its US$1 billion-plus valuation after a merger last month. Alibaba-backed logistics firm Best launched its US$930 million IPO on the New York Stock Exchange last week. \n",
      "Article 5: In brief: Honestbee faces millions in creditor demands, owes at least $209m Online food delivery startup Honestbee has received demands from creditors claiming S$6 million (US$4.3 million), and owes at least US$209 million to its largest creditors, The Business Times reported citing an affidavit filed by the company at a Singapore High Court pre-trial conference. Honestbee also has outstanding leases for three units at Boon Leat Terrace for its dining and retail concept Habitat and its space at Blk 2 Tampines Logis Park. It's further saddled with leases for 19 vans from Goldbell Leasing and Think One Leasing, according to the documents. The embattled grocery startup's chief executive Ong Lay Ann's court affidavit shows that the company has also been served with four statutory demands for a total of S$940,942 (USD$681,000) since July 15 and 34 letters of demand for about S$5.1 million (US$3.7 million). Honestbee chairman Brian Koo, A Honestbee Pte Ltd, and venture investor Formation Group have expressed interest in investing up to US$10 million each in the company, according to letters attached to the affidavit. \n",
      "Article 6: Unearthing the Honestbee storyDear readers, Last week, we broke the news about layoffs and resignations at Honestbee - which came about after someone tipped me off about its temporary suspension in the Philippines. A little bit of digging unearthed problems in its operations as a whole. The story was widely cited, and it was followed by an article on TechCrunch that went into greater detail about the saga. I first met Honestbee founder Joel Sng back in 2014. At that time, he said the reason he started the company was so that he can help temp workers find jobs. People I’ve spoken to expressed regret at how things ended up. But the Honestbee story hasn’t really ended yet as it’s attempting to change its course. It has tough decisions to make in the months ahead, and Tech in Asia will certainly be following all the twists and turns. Don’t forget to subscribe to us if you’d like to support our efforts.

      "Article 8: Deep Dive: The Honestbee story (so far) Singapore-based grocery delivery startup Honestbee was a well-loved brand. Its brick-and-mortar grocery store, Habitat, was touted to have the world’s first checkout system that required minimal intervention from shoppers, as well as the first grocery collection system that was entirely reliant on robots. But news of Honestbee suspending operations in a number of its key markets uncovered a series of questionable corporate governance practices and a bad leadership culture. What went wrong?

      "Article 9: Online grocery startup Honestbee raises $15M from Silicon Valley to deliver the goods Online grocery delivery service Honestbee has raised US$15 million in a series A round, it announced today. Silicon Valley investment firm Formation 8 led the round. The company has a track record of investing in technology companies like Oculus VR. The round was joined by Silicon Valley venture fund Pejman Mar Ventures, an investor in Dropbox and Lending Club, as well as Facebook, Amazon, and Google luminaries Gideon Yu, Owen Van Natta, and Steve Chen. It’s an investment round with an unmistakable Bay Area flavor for the Singapore-based company. Honestbee provides online grocery delivery within one hour of ordering, the company claims. It uses freelance shoppers who receive the order on their phone, purchase the groceries, and deliver them to your door. The company has partnerships in Singapore with supermarket chains NTUC Fairprice and Cold Storage, pet products retailer Pet Lovers Center, and specialty retailers like Gastronomia da Paolo, Crystal Wines, and Four Seasons Organic. The company is operating in Singapore and has just announced its Hong Kong launch. Plans include expansion to another six major cities by June 2016, it says. In the last eight months, it has staffed up to 100 people and continues to look for more hires. “Most people in Asia are time-starved due to the demands of their job and a large proportion of the population do not possess their own vehicles,” co-founder Isaac Tay says in a statement. “With our on-demand delivery service, time-crunched customers can enjoy the widest choices from their favourite stores, even at the last minute.” Formation 8 founder, Brian Koo, says: “Formation 8 believes that the hyper-local on-demand market plays a significant role in the way commerce will evolve. Given the increasing population density across all the key cities in Asia due to job and wealth creation, this is right time and opportunity.” Joel Sng, a founder of Honestbee, is a general partner at Formation 8. See: Food fight: New challengers spice up Singapore’s online grocery war For a relatively small market like Singapore, the competition in online grocery delivery is heating up. Redmart is perhaps the major player in this area, while other competing services include GoFresh and PurelyFresh. Further out in the region, HappyFresh is currently operating in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Freshness abounds in the market, it seems. Redmart operates differently than Honestbee. It doesn’t use the Uber model for shoppers, but relies on its own warehousing and fleet infrastructure. HappyFresh, like Honestbee, relies on freelance shoppers, and is already operating in territories that Honestbee could be looking to enter (as any Southeast Asian startup in its right mind would, let’s face it). Plus, it has financial backing of its own in the seven-figure range by undisclosed investors. Honestbee cites a Goldman Sachs report which said the online grocery shopping market in Asia is estimated at US$18 billion. Meanwhile, developing markets in Asia Pacific are most willing to use online retail solutions like grocery delivery, according to Nielsen’s Global E-Commerce and The New Retail Report. The question, then, becomes whether competition can help the online grocery delivery space grow in Southeast Asia, or if it will start a race to the bottom. The latter case might be good news for consumers’ wallets, but it’s almost certainly bad news for any company that wants to remain sustainable. We have reached out to Honestbee for more details and we will update this story when we hear back. Who will win Asia's online groceries battle? Drop your comments below.\n",
      "Article 10: Odd transactions at Honestbee under ex-CEO Joel SngDear readers, Last week, our investigation into some odd transactions at Honestbee under former CEO Joel Sng finally dropped. Such articles validate Tech in Asia’s decision to go the paywall route. To give you a sense of what it took to get this out, we had to conduct numerous conversations with sources, parse through pages of documents, do meticulous fact-checking, and vet the story with a lawyer. Having subscribers gives us the resources to pursue in-depth reporting. But it's not all about economics. Ex-employees have told me how their lives have been negatively affected by their stints at Honestbee, and how our coverage serves as a form of catharsis for them. It also helps them explain to others what really happened in the company. I'm glad that we’ve played a small part in helping them move on with their lives.

      "Article 12: Goodbye and thank you, Honestbee“Journalism is printing what someone else does not want published; everything else is public relations.” - Anonymous We first heard the buzz about a potential Honestbee scoop around a year ago. Our chief correspondent Terence - who was still editor-in-chief back then - told me that we have insider information about Honestbee’s financials and inner workings. The newsroom was ready to dig deep and investigate. But truth be told, I was worried that while we were putting the story together, any misstep - whether valid or not - could cause us trouble. The society we live in favors the rich and powerful, after all. We pursued it anyway because that’s the core duty of journalists. We engaged lawyers and other professionals to advise us on what we can or cannot print. We probed and unearthed as much info as we could, and we believe that we’ve been fair. Actually, you can be the judge of that - catch all of our Honestbee stories here. Our latest piece is an exclusive interview with Brian Koo, a scion of the family that controls South Korean electronics giant LG. As a key investor in Honestbee, he was able to give a unique perspective and in-depth insights into what it was like working with ex-CEO Joel Sng. Sng’s rise and fall is a cautionary tale for founders, a clear illustration of what can happen when you take the mantra of “fake it until you make it” way too far. And while we believe doing a good job is its own reward, we always appreciate kind feedback from the community. Tech in Asia will remain fearless and vigilant so that we can continue to deliver high-quality journalism to this part of the world. Thank you for the lessons, Honestbee. But I think it’s also important to note that the troubled company isn’t representative of Southeast Asia’s tech community. The majority of the people in this industry have a good heart. Stay tuned as we have a series of noteworthy stories lined up. Please consider supporting us by subscribing. Stay safe and optimistic. 💪 Cheers, Willis\n",
      "Article 13: The irresponsible demise of HonestbeeLately, we’ve been covering a number of startups that have gone through rough times. Honestbee is the most famous one. We’ve also written about Tink Labs, which fell from its unicorn status, as well as bike-sharer OBike and airline loyalty app Mileslife. There's a couple more that we'll be discussing in the coming weeks. While there's plenty of advice on how to grow a startup, there's very little literature on how to gracefully and responsibly scale down a company. We'll just have to learn from others’ mistakes. It's unfortunate that Honestbee represents the height of startup hubris. While hindsight is always perfect, all fingers point to Joel Sng, the company’s ex-CEO and founder, who created a culture that apparently chased away good employees and stifled dissent. Honestbee lacked the right processes for its size. It didn't have a firm grasp of its unit economics and cashflow. Even as its cash dwindled, it was spending heavily just to look good in front of potential investors. It didn't intervene soon enough - Sng departed only when the company was in critical condition. Tech startups, especially consumer platforms, bear an enormous responsibility. If a restaurant shuts down, the effects can be contained. But if a platform disappears, more livelihoods are affected - we’re talking about suppliers and contract workers. Honestbee appears to owe at least US$209 million to various people, including vendors. I know of suppliers and contractors who were hit hard because a significant chunk of their revenue came from a single platform. Forget about shutting down - even a delay in payments could hurt their cashflow. These vendors are often small businesses or even individuals, sometimes. For them, cashflow is tight, and there aren't many options when it comes to raising capital. Of course, you can argue that suppliers should know what they're getting into and calculate the risks involved. But the odds are stacked against them because the information asymmetry is high. A fishmonger relying on Honestbee, for example, can hardly be expected to evaluate a public company's financial and managerial performance, let alone a private one. Startups have every incentive to be as opaque as possible. Fundraising is about selling the story of constant growth. Some startups, Honestbee included, pump up the numbers through marketing spending to make the chart look nicer. It's the \"fake it until you make it\" mentality. Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with it: many successful tech companies survive by the skin of their teeth in their early days. They were frequently months away from bankruptcy, until the arrival of some last-minute investment. But it's a different matter entirely if a company and its board are: a) doing a poor job of evaluating and tracking unit economics (a measure of how effectively a business is acquiring and keeping customers), b) avoiding or postponing hard decisions - such as layoffs - that improve unit economics or extend a company's runway, c) being willfully ignorant and casting aside dissenting voices that question the trajectory of the business, and d) thinking about the upper management's interests rather than the livelihood of its employees and suppliers. Unfortunately, there aren't many public examples of graceful exits by startups. The one I can think of is Indian startup GoZoomo, which returned half of the money it had invested after it determined that the business was unsustainable. \"The founding team decided that the unit economics were not adding up, despite several iterations in the business model. They looked at the data objectively and made the tough decision to shut shop instead of burning VC money on an unsustainable business,\" we wrote in an article about the company. Of course, plenty of public education can be done. Suppliers and contractors can be more discerning and ask savvier questions about the platforms that woo them. They can be stricter in terms of demanding payment. If the perks and terms are too good to be true, they probably won't last. The media can also play a role in educating the masses by digging deeper and scrutinizing unit economics. (At Tech in Asia, we're doing this - it's included in our list of standard questions for startups). Tech bubble As the hype about Southeast Asia continues to grow, there’ll be greater consequences. Startups like Honestbee and Tink Labs may be a symptom of too much money chasing after too few great entrepreneurs, and it does look like this status quo could intensify in Southeast Asia. Not content with raising one Vision Fund, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank has raised two. I wrote previously that the Vision Fund is itself a startup on the grandest scale. I'm still inclined to think it's ingenious. By investing an obscenely massive amount of money into category leaders like Grab and Oyo, for instance, SoftBank is putting immense pressure on their main rivals and scaring off potential competitors. SoftBank is also building a network of powerful relationships - which can make a difference in negotiating groundbreaking contracts. Look at who Masayoshi Son is associated with: Alibaba, Grab, Tokopedia, Uber, Oyo, and WeWork. And that’s just for starters. The strategy, however, could have huge ripple effects if these SoftBank-backed platforms take a wrong turn or put other players out of business. When times are good, it generates a false sense of security for suppliers and employees of these unicorns that rely on the trickle-down effects of inflated investment money. It also creates a distorted picture of the direction of the internet economy. It's hard to gauge real demand and sustainability of a service when it's propped up by subsidies. The strategy distorts hiring. As superapps compete for talent, it artificially inflates salaries for prized hires, causing other startups with less money to either match those offers or identify diamonds in the rough instead. But when these unicorns realize that they need to trim or divert their spending, suppliers and staff in their ecosystems will be hit. Projections that were once rosy will go awry. Entire departments will be lost. With investments and exits in Southeast Asia continuing to climb, it’s easy to be lulled into comfortable complacency. We need to stay on our toes and keep our eyes open.\n",

      "Article 15: Layoffs and resignations at Honestbee as regional expansion hits a snag Honestbee, a regional grocery and food delivery service headquartered in Singapore, is facing turbulence. In January, it \"temporarily paused\" its partnership with NTUC FairPrice, one of Singapore's largest supermarket chains, right before Lunar New Year. People were no longer able to buy groceries from FairPrice via the Honestbee app. In Taiwan, Honestbee allegedly owed money to its partner vendors, local media reported earlier this month. But the company said that it has paid 80% of the debt while the rest is being processed. Now, during Easter week, Honestbee has received resignations from senior executives and conducted a round of layoffs last week in several markets, including Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Thailand, multiple sources within the startup told Tech in Asia. According to sources, redundancies affected at least 50 to 70 people across all markets. In Thailand, 30 people in the food delivery and operations departments were hit. In Indonesia, more than five people were let go. An Honestbee spokesperson confirmed that 6% of the workforce was affected. At the last count, Honestbee had over 1,000 employees in the region. In addition, the company has also temporarily suspended food delivery operations in Hong Kong, and Thailand, following a \"strategic review,\" the spokesperson added. \"The status of Honestbee in the remaining markets remain unchanged.\" Operations in the Philippines was also stopped for the time being, despite the fact that the country is Honestbee's best-performing market, a source pointed out. Following behind the top market is Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan, the person added. Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Indonesia make up the bottom half. It is also among the top-ranking food and drink apps on Android and iOS in the Philippines, according to App Annie. Honestbee announced the suspension in the country in messages - seen by Tech in Asia - that were sent to partner merchants, contract workers, and customers over Easter weekend, a big holiday in the predominantly Catholic nation. The notice mentioned how the Singapore headquarters is working with the Philippine operations to bring the \"total business to a healthy and sustainable level.\" As such, there was a need to \"temporarily pause\" the local business until further notice. Filipino grocery runners employed by Honestbee told Tech in Asia that they were told about the suspension but received no explanation. One runner said that a meeting will be held today to clarify matters. According to local media, Honestbee maintains over a thousand freelance drivers and runners and employs over 200 full-timers. Customers have been reaching out to Honestbee via social media, asking about orders that were made. The startup responded by saying that credit and debit card payments will be refunded. \"Our operations are temporarily unavailable,\" went Honestbee's standard reply. Honestbee had announced that it will be back, though it didn't give a timeline. However, the closure means that freelance workers and merchants could move to other platforms, causing a potential downward spiral for the company's Philippine operations. Its website had earlier stated that it would be closed on April 18 to 19, or Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, respectively. On the international front, staff who have left or resigned in recent months include co-founder Isaac Tay, Malaysia country managing director Pulkit Manchanda, and Singapore managing director Chris Urban, their Linkedin profiles revealed. Aside from these departures, sources have told Tech in Asia that Hendro Tan, Honestbee's deputy managing director in Indonesia, is also exiting. A few employees have also told us that they wish to hand in their notice. We've sent the company several requests for comment regarding its cashflow, business performance, and strategic plans, but it has yet to respond. Since launching in 2015, Honestbee has rapidly grown its headcount. Over a hundred job postings, mostly in Singapore, are still active on Glassdoor. However, its employee ratings and reviews on the US-based jobs marketplace have been trending negatively. Honestbee's recent troubles came a few months after it launched its own supermarket, Habitat, in October 2018. Just a few days ago, it did some publicity for Habitat, touting it as a popular retail destination. Honestbee has raised at least US$49 million in funding following its US$15 million series A round in October 2015. It faces heated competition in Southeast Asia from other startups and well-funded super apps. On the grocery front, its rivals include Lazada-owned Redmart in Singapore, Metromart in the Philippines, and Grab- and Naver-backed HappyFresh in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. On the food delivery front, it's battling against GrabFood, Deliveroo, Foodpanda, and Go-Food. Update on Apr 23: Added statement from Honestbee.\n",
      "Article 16: In brief: Grocery delivery startup Honestbee hits cash crunch, eyes sale Honestbee is nearly out of money and it's trying to offload its business, TechCrunch reported. The company has held early conversations with a number of suitors in Asia, including ride-hailing giants Grab and Go-Jek, over the potential acquisition of part or all of its business, two sources familiar with the matter said. Internal numbers for Honestbee in December 2018 show that the startup lost nearly US$6.5 million, with around US$2.5 million in net revenue. Its gross merchandise volume reached nearly US$12.5 million, but costs - chiefly discounts to lure new customers and online marketing spend - dragged the company down. In recent months, the startup has reportedly laid off employees, “paused” its business in the Philippines, and closed its research and development centers in Vietnam and India. A source said the company currently doesn’t have the funds to pay its staff this month. \n",
      "Article 17: Food and groceries delivery firm Honestbee launches dining and retail concept It seems going offline by setting up or working with retail stores is a popular move by internet startups these days. Singapore-headquartered Honestbee, an on-demand service providing food, groceries, and laundry, will be opening its own dining and retail concept store in the city-state on October 18. Called Habitat by Honestbee, the \"tech-enabled\" store is a five-minute walk from Mapletree Business City, a major tech hub containing the offices of Google, Samsung, and the government's Info-communications Media Development Authority. Habitat by Honestbee is about the size of a football field, or 60,000 square feet. It has a variety of food stalls and an event space, and promises a cashless and queueless experience. Customers can use the Honestbee app to scan and pay. Those with 10 items or less can walk out with their purchases right away. For the rest, a system of robots and conveyor belts handle the sorting and packing. The space has many facets. It serves as a fulfillment center. Online grocery orders are prepared on-site and then delivered to the doorstep. It's also an R&D lab and a platform for its retail and F&B partners to have an inexpensive physical presence. For the launch, it will have 15 food concepts that are available for dine-in or takeaway. Online-to-offline (O2O) commerce - in which customers are driven from online channels to shop at physical locations - is a relatively new concept in Southeast Asia. The trend is in full bloom elsewhere. In the US, Amazon and startups like Warby Parker have been pioneering this concept. In China, Alibaba is putting the pedal to the metal with its Hema chain of supermarkets, which already has over 65 outlets since its 2015 launch. At Hema stores, customers use an app to find product information. Payment is made through Alibaba's payment system, Alipay. These stores collect data on consumers and double as distribution centers. The birth of \"new retail\" has traditional supermarkets and stores in jitters. Honestbee could bridge that gap, as it is partnering with major Singapore supermarket chain FairPrice as well as various restaurants and retailers to serve as a distribution channel. With the ecommerce race heating up in Asia, Honestbee is preparing for a fight. The startup has raised at least US$49 million since its series A round in 2015. A major backer appears to be South Korea's LS Group.\n",

      "Article 20: Rocket Internet’s back for more; Inside stories at Honestbee, Tink Labs become publicDear readers, Last week, news about Honestbee's astronomical US$180 million debt broke out. We also found out more details about Tink Labs' shutdown and apparent reboot. Subscribers to Tech in Asia won't be surprised by these moves - we've been covering these startups’ struggles in-depth for a while now. Do subscribe to us for more insider info you won't get elsewhere. Speaking of insider news, read our story on how Gushcloud weathered a PR disaster and is now growing and profitable. What struck me about these three companies is how PR crises typically aren’t what kills a company. Instead, poorly managed startups - or startups that don't learn quickly from mistakes - often implode or simply run out of steam. In other developments, we got wind of how Rocket Internet is set to launch the next wave of ventures in Southeast Asia. We also took a peek at a study claiming that Ovo is Indonesia's top e-wallet app. Check out the rest of our premium content from the past week: #Startuplyfe More Southeast Asian founders are getting MBAs.

      "Article 21: What it’s like to shop at Southeast Asia’s smartest, most Instagrammable supermarketHonestbee created a buzz when it launched its first brick-and-mortar store in Singapore, which is touted to have a couple of world firsts - the first checkout system that requires almost no intervention from the shopper, and the first grocery collection system that relies entirely on robots. See: Behind Honestbee’s big offline move and rapid expansion to 1,000 employees These features, along with many others, make it the \"smartest\" supermarket in Southeast Asia - though the verdict is still pending on its actual benefits to shoppers. Below is a visual walkthrough of what it's like to shop at Habitat at Honestbee. (All photos and videos by Tech in Asia.) The Habitat lobby is a wall (and ceiling) of green. To enter and exit, you'll need to register on Honestbee. This helps keep out shoplifters, too. Not shown: you can actually buy flowers at the entrance in case your wife's unhappy, jokes celebrity Bobby Tonelli, who was there to entertain press visitors. The store houses over 20,000 items and 15 food concepts. The high ceiling gives a spacious feel, and the abundant windows and natural lighting help with taking good snaps. An over-the-air conveyer belt transfers goods to the packing room that are then shipped out to customers. This is how a \"bee\" transports goods from the shelves at Habitat to the packing room. Dry-aged beef on display. The store is not located in the city center, which means it's counting on gourmet offerings like these to draw in foodies. Fresh seafood is available. Habitat has a large sitting area where you can lounge around. You can buy books, coffee, and cakes. While it has many items on display in shelves, it keeps even more goods in the back of house, which can be ordered on large touchscreens like these. The bar might draw a crowd from the nearby Mapletree Business City for after-work drinks. The Honestbee team has a taste for art. Previously, I saw some paintings at their old office in Little India. Now, there's an art gallery at Habitat. Also spotted: two giant stone sculptures somewhere in the supermarket. The checkout system is seamless. Push your trolley in, scan your app, and within a couple of minutes, you'll get a notification stating that your items are ready for collection. In the back room, staff will do the packing and scanning for you. In the meantime, you can continue browsing the store. ﻿ After checking out of the store, you'll need to scan your app once again to collect your items. A warehouse robot, provided by GeekPlus Robotics, comes to life and wheels the goods to you. A surprising find at the exit: a hydroponics farm. You can plant your own vegetables there, and collect them once they're ready. If you don't, the plants will be used as ingredients in Honestbee's kitchen. And that's the end of the tour.

      "Article 22: Why you don’t say ‘sorry’ in error and info messagesOne of the first tasks I had to do after joining Honestbee was to review some error messages. As an average user (my background is in content marketing), I had never paid any attention to error content. Whenever I saw the word “sorry,\" I spaced out. Faced with the task, I did my utmost best to make the messages consistent and pleasant and started every single one with the word sorry. And I did this not just for error messages, but all kinds of informational content. I think there are two reasons for it: Lots of products do it. I thought it was the norm. I wanted to be kind and empathetic to our users. As for number one, lots of other people doing something does not a good reason make. \"It’s more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy.\" -Steve Jobs Number two is a more complex issue. At Honestbee, each of us at the design team has to experience conducting user research and doing customer service. I love it. It has allowed me to become more empathetic and to truly look at things from a perspective that is very different from my own. I thought that by saying sorry, I was making the content more human and preventing users from getting angry. One day at a design review, my manager asked me why I use the word sorry. The simple answer was that I had never considered not to. But it made me think, what real value was I adding with that word? Look at the message below. A user’s card has expired. It is not a big deal and can happen to anyone. It seems that I am turning a neutral situation into a bad one. Why am I making the user feel bad? I think the worst \"sorry use case\" is when content designers apologize for how the product or service functions. If you are putting your user in a situation where you can’t do anything but apologize—a horrible situation with no upside—rethink the whole product or service. Talk to operations, businesses, designers, and the CEO if need be. Just saying sorry won’t help. It is easy to view any restriction imposed on the user as a bad thing. For example, we could say sorry every time a user tries to add items from multiple restaurants to a cart. But we don’t. Yes, it is a restriction, however, we truly want to do the best for our customers. We believe that this “restriction” improves the overall service experience. Of course, an info message is not the place to explain our business decisions in length but we can be more positive about the whole thing. If we were to constantly apologize for our business decisions, we would eventually convince our users that our product isn’t a very good one, even if they once thought otherwise. Another reason why “restrictions” can be good is that we are not targeting every single person on the planet. Like all businesses, we are building our product for a particular “buyer persona.\" We use “restrictions” to make the product better for our ideal customers. Of course, I don’t at all mean that you should never apologize. My customer service training taught me that when things truly go wrong, no beautifully written template answer can stand up to a sincere, human apology. However, info and error messages are not meant to deal with individual situations. I see them as educational content that will be consumed by masses. It is inevitable that we will make mistakes, but I think we should aim not to make them on a large scale and not with frightening regularity. If it were to happen, the solutions aren't to create a bunch of apologetic error messages, but to fix the business. Disclaimer: At Honestbee we are not yet free of sorry error and info messages, but I’ve made it one of my goals for Q1 2017 to free us of negative content that doesn't do anything for our users but slightly worsen their mood. This is an opinion piece. This article was first published on Medium. \n",
      "Article 23: Editor’s letter: An investor questioned Tech in Asia for not exposing a lie earlierDear readers, After we published our explosive story on the lies of Honestbee’s founder years ago, an investor chided us for not exposing this deception at the earliest possible instance. After all, we could have prevented a tragedy that cost many people their livelihoods, he said. He had a point. However, the truth is that it’s hard going against the grain to publish exposés about media darlings basking in the glow of puff pieces and adoring fans. No one wants to be the first to tarnish their shiny armor. Stars must align: Uncovering solid evidence and finding sources willing to risk talking to journalists are key. And even if our reporting is fair and accurate, it’s easy for others to allege bias or challenge our credibility. All this is par for the course, so I’m not complaining. As a popular saying goes, journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed. Everything else is public relations. We’ve been working toward that ideal ever since we launched our paid subscription product almost five years ago (time flies). Since then, we’ve grown up our investigative journalism muscles and sharpened our ability to unearth evidence and protect our sources. We’re definitely more critical in our coverage of tech’s rising stars. But the truth is that journalism remains labor-intensive and costly, even if it’s augmented with AI tools. Truth be told, if our goal is solely to make money, it’s better to avoid doing journalism. After all, why risk pissing off advertisers and people in power? Some local media in Asia, even the big players, have been known to take money or make under-the-table deals in exchange for publishing positive news. Our code of ethics and disclosure policy forbid this hidden revenue stream. This is why we continue to bet on our subscription model, and why we’re offering you this limited-time 50% discount. This is our commitment to quality journalism that’s worth paying for. Get 180 days freeThis offer ends in three days.

      "Article 24: 5 tips on doing good user research for startupsMy design folks always ask me if I do user research at Honestbee. Of course, we do! In fact, with a startup's limited resources, it’s even more important to have user research. In the Warm Gun 2014 conference, Branden Kowitz gave great points about how startup designers can focus on what really matters: It is the curiosity of what problems you wanna tackle, the maker spirit of getting your hands dirty, and the iterations that have been validated in front of people as early as possible. As a product designer, understanding users and learning the most from iterations are the premise of your design. But how do you make user research effective and valuable for startups? Below are some notes that I’ve learned along the way. Demographics and goals Ensure you’re seeking the appropriate participants, tools, and means for your study. Use the 5W1H framework—Why do you want to do the research? What do you want to know? Who will be involved in the sessions? Where is the proper place to conduct it? When are the proper deadlines? How do you conduct the research with limited resources? How many sessions will you conduct? This can go on and on. By understanding all of the above, you’re making sense of the plan, revealing insights, and using clearly defined goals as a guide. Be flexible and creative Having a design background, I’ve been attached to holistic qualitative methodologies and processes for years namely, understanding who your participants are, the contextual inquiry, and observations, which normally would consume a decent amount of resources to achieve. However, for fast-moving startups, designers need to be flexible and creative with their limited time and resources. That’s how you make your research agile. Here are some interesting stories about how we found ways to conduct research in an agile way. Startups are not academic organizations; designers need to play smart and be resourceful to conduct design research. Seek out your co-workers and brainstorm innovative ways to conduct the research that fits the occasion. Make proper fidelity prototypes No one wants to throw out a digital prototype that took hours to make. However, investing in the right level of a prototype presents your study without wasting time. After seeing lost and confused users in some experimental sessions, I believe that a proper fidelity prototype is key to an efficient user research. In the article Paper Prototyping: The 10-Minute Practical Guide by UXPin, Jerry Cao highlighted the disadvantages of paper prototyping: There’s just no way to replicate the experience of using a digital product on paper, no matter how detailed it is. Paper prototypes require a great deal of imagination, and there’s a lot lost when imagining what a product will be like. What the users are thinking may be different than what you are, but the feedback doesn’t reflect this. It might even be quicker to build prototypes with software than to spend time with paper before making it digital. Online templates such as UI8 and Sketch App Sources allow you to integrate photos or content you need. Prototyping tools like invision, flinto, or principle empower you to make mockups that look almost real. All of these help build solid prototypes fast and prevents users from getting lost in the sessions. Invite relevant co-workers to the sessions The great thing I like about user research is understanding the things you thought you knew but actually didn’t. I also especially like inviting developers and product managers to the sessions. Sometimes, developers see blind spots that you wouldn't have thought of and product managers suggest ideas for new features. Their insights come from different perspectives and backgrounds. When you start to make your user study a team-wide activity, it not only fosters collaboration, but it also helps other team members focus on the core user problems. It’s definitely a non-zero sum game. Outcomes made easy and insightful You’ve carefully planned ahead, got your hands dirty from making tons of prototypes, and finished all the user research. As a finial step, focus on the analysis and share the data. This is the most valuable step of your research. As Erika Hall mentioned in Just Enough Research: Whatever type of research you’re doing and wherever it falls in your schedule, follow these six steps: 1. Define the problem; 2. select the approach; 3. plan and prepare for the research; 4. collect the data; 5. analyze the data; 6. report the results. With practice, the first three steps will become muscle memory and you can focus on collecting, analyzing, and sharing the data. Proper documentation for the topic and your organization is key. A presentation, report, or something as simple as an email would be great. Don’t make a lengthy 50-page report if it's not needed, and remember to avoid beating around the bush. Summing up with pain points, direct action items, and suggestions is always good. Getting user research done in a startup is a huge challenge because of the hectic demands and pressure. However, user research is powerful in revealing core problems, the right products to develop, and the right audience. Hopefully, this short note helps those who are new as a startup designer. Make the best of your expertise to boost your user-centric startup strategy. This is an opinion piece. This article was first published on Medium.\n",
      "Article 25: Food fight: New challengers spice up Singapore’s online grocery war At a cramped office in Singapore's Little India, journalists awaited the unveiling of Honestbee, a new grocery shopping site. The space was already sardined with the startup's fast expanding team, which ballooned from a handful to 55 in just a few months. Some staff vacated the room to accommodate the curious outsiders. The live demo was unpolished but charming. Jonathan Low, the tall and bespectacled co-founder of Honestbee, received a staged phone call from a delivery guy confirming his order. He explained what Honestbee is: an Instacart-like service which assigns a freelance runner to buy groceries on your behalf from the nearest supermarket. The items are then sent straight to you. Everyone guessed that a delivery man would show up at the door. \"Delivery takes time, so let's wait a little bit,\" he said, breaking the awkward silence. The knock finally came. \"Now, I wonder who that is?\" He asked, relieved. The runner entered with two full bags. Honestbee is the latest entrant in Singapore's online grocery battle, and it's eager to prove it can deliver the goods. Casual observers probably won't spot many differences between the service and its competitors, which now include RedMart, PurelyFresh, and GoFresh. Even supermarkets like Cold Storage are upping the ante with a revamped online shopping site. Indeed, they all seem to work the same way, as I found out after trying Honestbee one weekend. After entering your postal code, the site tells you what merchants are available in the area. You then select one of its partners - from supermarkets like Cold Storage and Sheng Siong to smaller setups like Pet Lovers Centre and Gastronomia. Next comes putting items in your shopping cart, picking a time slot, and checking out. The service waives delivery fees for basket sizes above a certain amount. And, if all goes well - and it usually does - the delivery guy rings your doorbell at the appointed time. So far so good. But where Honestbee really shines is its promise of delivering groceries to you within an hour. Well, more like two hours, as the case was for me. I made my purchase at 11.30am, and the earliest time slot I could choose was 1pm to 2pm. One-hour ranges are the best anyone can do in Singapore now, though Honestbee wants to eventually introduce 30-minute slots. The startup is part of a rising class of \"on-demand\" services that aims to give you what you want, as soon as you want it. Uber pioneered the idea of using existing resources (idle private vehicles) and summoning them to anyone through an app. Instacart takes the same concept to groceries, and Honestbee applies the same model to Singapore. Joel Sng, the enigmatic backer and CEO of Honestbee, has committed to funding the company through to the end of 2016. When a journalist prodded him on how he amassed enough cash to invest, Sng didn't say. But the Harvard graduate was notably an investor in startups like Facebook, Uber, Palantir, and Airbnb. Sng then returned to Singapore initially to run his family office. He didn't divulge how much he's investing in the company, except to say that \"you can't do this business with six figures.\" His pensiveness contrasts with the eclectic, splashy decor of the office, which includes rows of cinema seats, a charming cafe, and a huge pop art piece originally commissioned for a bank by an artist called Steve Lawler. Lifeopp, a LinkedIn for service workers, was Honestbee's previous reincarnation. While Lifeopp didn't work out, it shares one common trait with the online groceries site - a social mission of providing employment to blue collar workers. \"We could’ve chosen to sell flowers or durians. Or car tires. As long as we’re able to build a highly retentive audience, as long as we’re able to grow our customer base and get them to come back frequently, we can provide the masses with quite a lot of income opportunities. And that’s the reason we started this,\" said Sng. These workers are the lifeblood of Honestbee. Unlike RedMart, which has built out an entire supply chain from picking and packing to last-mile delivery, Honestbee has none of that. Instead, it uses a network of 500 freelance shoppers who fan out all over Singapore. Runners are paid about S$10 (US$7.30) an hour plus incentives if they perform well. They get an app which has mapped out the retail space in advance. It tells them which aisle they should go to pick up the item, as well as how to walk there. Honestbee worked out revenue sharing agreements with its partner merchants, and that is how it keeps costs low and pays its contract workers. The partnerships also allow Honestbee runners to be recognized as such, which means they can sometimes bypass the queue. With a thin margin of error afforded by instant deliveries, every extra second helps. The fact that the market is getting crowded is not lost on ex-investment banker Roger Egan, co-founder and CEO of RedMart, a startup founded in 2011. It is credited with pushing the boundaries of online groceries and ecommerce in Singapore. Hot on the heels of Honestbee's launch, RedMart held its own presser, which also had a bazaar-in-a-bar where organic food, fruit jam, and wine sellers displayed their wares. The event signified a shift for RedMart - from merely a retailer of groceries to a marketplace for merchants. In essence, you can now buy craft beer from a specialty store alongside a bottle opener sitting in RedMart's warehouse. With on-demand being the flavor of the month, it's easy to see RedMart as a has-been. But Egan rubbished that notion. \"We think  works for certain product categories but I don’t think it scales for groceries,\" he told me. \"In groceries, you have many more items per order than other ecommerce. So, the efficiency of picking and packing those orders becomes really important at scale.\" He continued: \"Picking and packing from a physical store can never be as efficient as a fully automated fulfilment center. It’ll always cost more per pick. It’s good for lowering delivery time and for convenience. But once you have to scale up, it’s not as efficient because physical retail space is more expensive and has less throughput.” Describing RedMart as an online supermarket is a misnomer. It's partially a logistics operation which rents its own warehouses and delivery fleet. Much of its innovation doesn't happen on its much-lauded website, but in the hidden gears that ship the groceries. Egan of course prefered to keep his technology under wraps. But he did say RedMart has created its own Android software for picking items at a warehouse and for goods delivery. Automation is critical if RedMart wants to survive. After all, the cost of robotics trend downwards, while labor costs tend to rise, said Egan. According to financial documents I obtained, the startup suffered a loss before taxes of S$40.3 million (US$29.4 million) on a revenue of S$12.9 million (US$9.43 million) for the financial year ending 2014. Granted, the loss may stem from investments in infrastructure and research, which might pay off in the future. So actual operating expenses might be lower than the stated loss. In any case, Egan says that their financial situation has changed a lot since. RedMart's delivery density has increased - which meant it was able to deliver more goods to a single area. \"In some of our most dense buildings, our cost per delivery has decreased significantly. That's because the marginal cost of delivering an additional order per building at the same time slot is much, much less,\" he said. The company can also nudge shoppers towards picking time slots that save RedMart the most money. For example, if five of my neighbors have requested for groceries to be sent to their doorsteps between 4 and 5 pm, I will get a few extra dollars discounted if I pick the same time period. \"We can influence you to pick a slot when we’re already going to be there. So that cuts our cost down by increasing delivery density,\" he said. RedMart's transition into a marketplace - it already has over 100 independent sellers offering 8,000 items - is aimed at reducing cost while offering shoppers more variety. RedMart doesn't store these items in their warehouse. Instead, sellers can use its logistics network and website to reach out to more customers. They get an online store, inventory, and analytics management system all rolled into one. With help and funding from government agency SPRING Singapore, it’ll train these merchants to use these services and be ready for RedMart’s vans when they do their pickups. In anticipation of the rise in demand, RedMart will order 60 more vehicles, which would more than double its current fleet. While RedMart and Honestbee are similar on the surface, their philosophies differ. RedMart is betting heavily on owning the entire process with the hope it'll pay off as the number of orders rise. Getting there requires burning a hefty amount of cash, and it's banking on optimism from investors to sail through. Honestbee, on the other hand, hopes it can scale its network of crowdsourced runners. It wants to conquer the brave new frontier of on-demand logistics, a field that's still small and unproven - even Uber isn't close to cracking it yet. Nonetheless, Sng believes consumers will change behavior rapidly: \"While people can plan their lives, and some do, most people  last minute. In general, I’m quite impatient. I’d like to know exactly when I can get things.\" So, once people taste the milk and honey in the promised land of instant deliveries, Honestbee hopes they won’t turn back. Though the startups are fundamentally different, both value customer loyalty. After all, having a hundred customers who shop on your site repeatedly beats a thousand who visit once and never return. So it's a race to impress as many first-time users as possible - the heavily pregnant wife who's finding a trip to the supermarket impossible, or the newly-weds who moved into a new housing estate but face a lack of nearby retailers. Egan found that steadfast customers not only order more frequently, but their baskets also get bigger with each purchase. \"As our customers age, their average order value goes way up. So if you look at our earlier customer cohorts, they’re profitable,\" he said. Sng noticed this too. \"We do see a trend of people buying the minimum as a test and increase over time. If we do a good job they come back and they buy a bit more. They start with perishables and move to fresh and frozen items. We gain their trust. They become more adventurous, and give you more challenging tasks.\" Unlike Honestbee though, RedMart, is taking a more measured approach towards the so-called Uber-ization of logistics. Sure, it began offering limited same-day deliveries and will introduce an “express” option soon. But the company believes its underlying business is sound - doing ecommerce is still cheaper than starting a supermarket, given the soaring rental costs in Singapore. Besides, the concept of getting runners to do your shopping is not new. Egan pointed out the example of Tesco - one of the largest retailers in the world. \"They've already went through the cycle where they used to pick from the store. They ran into a few problems. Once the penetration increased - and it’s the highest in the UK - the replenishment of the shelves was an hourly problem. They weren’t able to keep things in stock. The online pickers in the store were also disrupting the experience for the regular store shoppers,\" said Egan. To tackle this, Tesco launched dark stores, which are simply stores devoid of shoppers except for the online pickers. Egan contended that these are still not as efficient as warehouses. Speaking of Instacart, he added: “The fulfilment cost is higher when you take the Instacart model plus the store. You have to think of all that as one full platform.” Sure, the model might attract supermarkets who fear the impact of ecommerce on their bottom line. But as long as they're not willing to give up their stores, they'll still lose out long-term. Egan believes that even Instacart is now struggling to control customer experience at scale. In fact, they now have to move from contract workers to part-time employees, as that improves quality and efficiency. \"Obviously, I've thought about this a lot,\" he smiled. Update on November 19: We previously said that Joel Sng is the great grandson of Sun Yat-Sen, based on a Bloomberg article. Joel has said that this is incorrect.\n",
      "Article 26: Redmart is still losing money. But its revenue is growing fast. Online groceries in Singapore has been mostly dominated by local startups Redmart and Honestbee. As services, they’re valuable - I’ve made frequent use of them both, resulting in so much time saved. Most importantly, they’ve kept me coming back, making me a “sticky customer.” But is the grass green on the business side? Redmart’s recent financial statement shows that the company is still losing money, but its revenue grew 267 percent from 2014 to 2015. While financial statements obtained by Tech in Asia showed a net loss of US$70.8 million for the annual period ending June 2015, Redmart clarified that over 70 percent of that figure has been attributed to non-cash losses. \"Non-cash losses are expenses on the P&L statement that have zero cash impact, for example, depreciation or fair market value adjustments. Similar to depreciation, fair market value adjustments for derivative instruments (like our preference shares) show up as expenses on the P&L but are added back to calculate cash flow from operations,\" said Vikram Rupani, co-founder of Redmart. As such, Redmart's operating loss for 2015 is US$21 million, It's operating loss margin is 78 percent, which was maintained from 2014. Redmart also had US$126 million in total liabilities, which is basically debt. However, the company says that most of it is attributed to preference shares (which is registered as a liability due to anti-dilution clauses) it gave out to investors. The company’s revenues have been climbing since 2013, from US$1.5 million to US$9.6 million in 2014, to 2015’s US$27 million figure. Redmart expects to be self-sustainable by mid-2017. The company is rumored to be raising a US$100 million round. Redmart declined to comment on that. Other investors say figures like these are not by themselves cause for concern. East Ventures’ Willson Cuaca, who is an investor in Redmart, tells Tech in Asia that for the type of service Redmart offers, these costs are inevitable. “I think they are building a solid business and tech,” he says. (Disclosure: East Ventures is also an investor in Tech in Asia. See our ethics page for details.) Most startups in a high-growth stage have figures that look like that, an unnamed investor who did not invest in Redmart tells Tech in Asia. “They’re burning capital in order to gain market.” It’s not much different from what Uber is doing (at its own, insane scale obviously). It’s perhaps a problem unique to startups, businesses that focus more on growing rapidly and worrying about profitability later. “Once they do have the market, services like  become a habit,” the investor adds. “You keep coming back, you use them regularly.” Crucial to Redmart’s sustainability are figures like customer acquisition costs, customer retention, number of deliveries, etc. Again, Roger declines to share any of those - most startups try to maintain a competitive advantage by not disclosing those numbers. It also makes it harder for outside observers to really know what’s going on within the company. “The question is, how effective are you in capturing your market with every dollar you’re spending?” the investor asks. “If you stop burning all that money, do you have a profitable business then?” Update on July 9, 1.24pm SGT: Tech in Asia made an error by neglecting to mention that the bulk of the net loss was due to non-cash reasons. As such, their operating loss margin is 78%, which is much smaller than we portrayed. We apologize for the mistake.\n",
      "Article 27: Can on-demand lifestyle services make a comeback?Every day, 100k+ smart people read our newsletter. You can sign up here. Hello readers, A few years ago, when I was still writing in the lifestyle space, I wrote a piece about Honestbee’s on-demand laundry service in Singapore. Well, we all know how the Honestbee story ended, but the fate of on-demand lifestyle services - such as laundry, house-cleaning, and massages, just to name a few - is still a bit of a question mark. In Indonesia, there appears to be plenty of potential for on-demand lifestyle services to take off, with its growing middle class, sizable workforce, and affordable labor costs. But the sector faces some difficulties in getting off the ground. Today we look at: What’s holding back on-demand lifestyle services in Indonesia Gojek’s newest offering for small businesses Other newsy highlights such as Oyo’s latest round of layoffs and WhatsApp’s new “Cart” function PREMIUM SUMMARY It’s a hard-knock life for on-demand lifestyle services in Indonesia GoLife, the on-demand lifestyle services unit of Gojek, had over 1 million monthly active users at its peak - before it got shut down early this year. And while Indonesia seems like a ripe environment for on-demand lifestyle services to thrive, businesses in the space don’t seem to be faring too well. Going lean: Many startups in the sector began by offering a wide range of services that connected gig workers to customers, but wound up whittling them down to only a few. Others have pivoted into the business-to-business space. Aside from making razor-thin profit margins, having too many services made it difficult for companies to scale, and some offerings - like makeup assistance - don’t have mass appeal. It ain’t as easy as it seems: Companies in the on-demand lifestyle services space face many challenges. For one, affluent households in Indonesia have maids and drivers, which make services like house-cleaning and laundry redundant. Plus, customers and service providers alike can bypass these platforms by exchanging contact information. A question of potential: The fact that GoLife had a sizable user base before Gojek pulled the plug indicates that there is a demand for on-demand lifestyle services. However, the lack of investor interest and funding going into the space makes it difficult for businesses to get off the ground.

Existing investors such as Temasek, 5AM Ventures, and Arboretum Ventures, among others, participated in this round. Founded in 2013, Pear Therapeutics offers a software-based digital therapeutics platform that combines digital interventions with drugs to enhance their efficacy. It has a pipeline of products and product candidates across therapeutic areas, including three prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs), which it claims is effective in disease treatment. Its flagship product, reSET, is used for the treatment of substance use disorders. The company claims reSET is the first PDT to receive marketing authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat such disorders. The fresh funding will help the company accelerate reimbursement coverage for its commercial products. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH One man’s trash is another man’s treasure Remember the pictures of pelicans coated in heavy oil that went viral in 2010, in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? It’s been 10 years since then, but those images are still pretty haunting to me. The issue of water pollution - accidental or intentional - is a significant one, and industrial players are one of the largest contributors to the problem. In fact, a lot of wastewater from factories, which contains chemicals, oils, and sewage, among other nasty things, gets dumped into natural bodies of water. This is a problem that Singapore-based waste solutions startup EcoWorth Tech is trying to solve. The company is on a mission to turn “waste into worth”, and wants to transform waste materials into reusable products. It’s current focus is on removing contaminants from wastewater, a process that would allow water to be reused or released into the environment safely and potentially monetize the materials that get recovered in the process. Those are some pretty lofty goals - and it certainly hasn’t been an easy journey for the company to get to this point. We heard from Andre Stolz, CEO and co-founder of EcoWorth, and found out more about his entrepreneurial journey, how EcoWorth got started, and where it’s headed. He opened up about the ups and downs he has experienced with EcoWorth, how his mindset as an entrepreneur has evolved over the years, and the opportunities that await the company in the future. Check out this video to learn more about Stolz, EcoWorth, and how they want to make a difference. QUICK BYTES 1️⃣ SoftBank’s contemplating a “slow-burn” buyback According to people familiar with the matter, SoftBank is debating on a new strategy to go private, which involves gradually buying back outstanding shares until its founder Masayoshi Son has a big enough stake in the company to squeeze out the remaining investors. This comes after nearly five years of discussions over whether the company should go private. 2️⃣ More layoffs at Oyo Hospitality unicorn Oyo has laid off close to 300 employees in its operations team, say sources close to the matter. This comes after Oyo shifted to a revenue-sharing model that allows the budget hotels startup to operate with fewer people. More job cuts may be in the offing, as the company aims to extend its runway amid the impact Covid-19 has had on the hospitality industry. 3️⃣ Combining clouds I Squared Capital, through its ISQ Global Infrastructure Fund II, has acquired and combined two cloud migration services companies based in Singapore: InfoFabrica and Cloud Kinetics. The combined entity will be able to provide cloud migration and management services to a wider Southeast Asian and Indian audience. 4️⃣ Apple to remove unlicensed games on its China App Store Apple announced today that any remaining paid games that are not approved by Chinese authorities by December 31 will be removed from its App Store in the country, ending a six-month-long purge of unlicensed games. This means that it will be almost impossible for international mobile game makers to access the Chinese market if they don’t comply with the country’s content rules. 5️⃣ WhatsApp rolls out its shopping feature globally Messaging service WhatsApp has launched a new shopping feature called “Carts” globally, which allows customers to browse a catalog, select multiple products, and send orders as one message to businesses on the service. This comes after the introduction of its shopping button last month. 6️⃣ Go go GoStore Indonesian ride-hailing unicorn Gojek has announced the launch of GoStore, a solution that helps local micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) set up online stores easily. It is part of the company’s Melaju Bersama Gojek initiative, which helps MSMEs find suitable Gojek solutions for their businesses.

      "Article 28: Letter to readers: The dark side of super appsDear readers, What happens when a super app is managed irresponsibly or runs out of money? Suppliers get hit, contractors lose a major source of income, and employees go unpaid. In my opinion piece, The irresponsible demise of Honestbee, I talk about why platform owners need to hold themselves to a higher level of responsibility and watch their unit economics like a hawk. I argue that the media has a part to play in spotlighting a startup’s unit economics over pure hype, and you can certainly help Tech in Asia play this role by subscribing. On the brighter side of things, we also looked at Fave, which has started its series C process in a bid to become the leading super app for merchants. Staying on the super app theme, we examined why Visa's backing both Grab and Gojek, and looked at the significance of Indonesia’s president calling Grab the country’s fifth unicorn. Finally, we peeked under Carro's hood. The \"Alibaba for cars\" is growing fast and is near breakeven. It has abandoned the classified model in favor of offering a full suite of services for the used car ecosystem.

      "Article 29: Online grocery wars: Grab challenges Lazada for dominanceSoutheast Asia’s ecommerce giants and brick-and-mortar supermarkets are accelerating their push into the online grocery space, thanks to an unexpected boost from the Covid-19 pandemic. This means the region’s ecommerce landscape is shifting. Lazada’s RedMart was a pioneer in Singapore and faced no real rival. Honestbee, in hindsight, had been set up to fail. Amazon loomed large when it entered the market, but it still trails behind regional ecommerce competitors. But Grab is intensifying the fight for dominance in the nascent market and putting intense pressure on Lazada. Shopee, meanwhile, is on the prowl with its own take on the business. Heating up As an online service, grocery delivery is still in its early days. Ecommerce players were testing the waters before the pandemic, but adoption was still low. The surge in demand last year, however, is turning online groceries into a new battleground. It’s one of the fastest-rising ecommerce categories in Southeast Asia, growing by 2x to 2.5x in 2020 compared to 2019. Research has shown that grocery is a US$350 billion market in Southeast Asia, with only 0.3% penetration. Grab, in particular, has been ramping up its efforts in grocery delivery, and its increasing interest in the space means it’s going up against Lazada. RedMart, the ecommerce platform’s grocery arm, entered the scene early in 2011 and currently dominates the Singapore market. Beyond Singapore, however, Lazada doesn't use the RedMart brand for its grocery service. That's because RedMart is not a household name elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the company tells Tech in Asia. In the Philippines, for example, it offers online grocery delivery service under a brand called LazMart. Meanwhile, Grab teamed up with Indonesia’s HappyFresh to launch GrabFresh in the country and Thailand in 2018. Grab Ventures, the super app’s accelerator unit, is an investor in HappyFresh. Frenemies? The relationship between the Grab and the Indonesian startup, however, isn’t so clear cut. The Southeast Asian giant recently introduced GrabSupermarket, a grocery delivery service that’s only available in Malaysia, pitting it against HappyFresh, which also operates in the country. Grab also offers grocery delivery in the Philippines and Singapore. Its grocery arm has expanded from two to eight countries in the past three months, and its partner base increased fourfold from June to over 12,000 stores in September. Lazada and Grab also have complicated ties. They’re competing on groceries in Malaysia even as they announced greater collaboration in Vietnam. Other players are also eyeing the space. Myanmar’s Oway, for instance, began offering online grocery services as Covid-19 decimated the ride-hailing and travel sectors. Indonesia’s Gojek, which discontinued grocery shopping service GoMart two years ago, is also stepping up its efforts. A profitable future? To succeed in a market where many struggle with thin margins, players need to do more than just meet the surge in demand. They also have to find the right business model and managing costs. There are three common grocery delivery models in Southeast Asia. RedMart employs the warehouse model, where all the groceries are sourced and picked from one fulfillment center and then delivered via its in-house delivery fleet. Similarly, LazMart’s items are stored in Lazada’s fulfillment hubs. Grab is experimenting with a similar end-to-end model with GrabSupermartket in Malaysia. But GrabMart, the company’s main online grocery feature, is based on the concierge model, where the platform does not manage the inventory itself. Upon receiving the order, the platform transfers the details directly to its delivery personnel and professional shoppers who are responsible for shopping and delivering the items. GrabMart made its debut in late 2019 and expanded across the region early last year. The concierge model allows Grab to do on-demand delivery, providing users with more flexibility because they don’t have to preschedule their orders. A Grab spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that the company hopes to fill a gap in end-to-end grocery delivery, which relies heavily on prescheduling. “This model can be inflexible, impacting supermarkets’ ability to scale when demand for grocery delivery boomed during the lockdown,” he says. RedMart’s warehouse model offers pre-scheduled deliveries and a wider variety of products, which is critical in driving repeat usage among consumers. There’s also more room for cost savings, which could be passed down to consumers. “We have industry-leading levels of low food waste, achieved through accurate forecasting and replenishment, as well as significantly reduced handling of perishable foods, which happens at physical supermarkets,” said Richard Ruddy, chief retail officer and head of grocery at Lazada Singapore. The downside, however, is that sudden uptick in demand has temporarily paralyzed RedMart’s logistic networks. Last but not least is the community-oriented group buying model, where a platform gives out discounts to encourage bulk orders and depends on \"community leaders\" to help with user acquisition, sales, and marketing efforts. Like many online groceries, RedMart has yet to achieve profitability, but the warehouse model has proven to be sustainable outside of Singapore. For example, UK-based Ocado has a gross margin of around 33%. That’s lower than ecommerce firms generate, but it’s considered phenomenal in the sector. The British online supermarket was net profitable from 2014 to 2017. “While we can draw parallels from Ocado in similar aspects of the business, it is operating in a different market and is much more mature. It is a good benchmark to reference, but we are following our own timeline based on the market conditions in Singapore,” said Lazada’s Ruddy. For Grab, it’s unclear whether its fledgling online grocery arm is profitable compared to peers that have also adopted the concierge model. For example, US-based Instacart recorded its first monthly net profit in April 2020 after eight years in business. HappyFresh, which also operates under a concierge model, has seen profitable unit economics since 2017, according to CEO Guillem Segarra. He says that having other revenue streams apart from grocery delivery, such as advertisements and partnerships, is key. HappyFresh recorded a net profit in Indonesia in the first quarter of 2020. Covid-19 has provided fuel to propel ecommerce adoption in Southeast Asia, but can the momentum last? There seems to be a lot of optimism, with a recent study showing that the pandemic is giving online groceries a permanent bump. “We are seeing significant headway here, with our customers exhibiting cross-buying behavior in both the Lazada and RedMart marketplaces,\" notes Ruddy. Grab is also upbeat about its prospects, and it’s focused on bringing GrabMart to more areas in the region. “We will continue our expansion by growing our partner base, investing in technology and operations to ace grocery deliveries. Our goal is to bring GrabMart into all 394 cities that Grab is currently operating in,” the company spokesperson says.\n",

Frenemies? The relationship between the Grab and the Indonesian startup, however, isn’t so clear cut. The Southeast Asian giant recently introduced GrabSupermarket, a grocery delivery service that’s only available in Malaysia, pitting it against HappyFresh, which also operates in the country. Grab also offers grocery delivery in the Philippines and Singapore. Its grocery arm has expanded from two to eight countries in the past three months, and its partner base increased fourfold from June to over 12,000 stores in September. Lazada and Grab also have complicated ties. They’re competing on groceries in Malaysia even as they announced greater collaboration in Vietnam. Other players are also eyeing the space. Myanmar’s Oway, for instance, began offering online grocery services as Covid-19 decimated the ride-hailing and travel sectors. Indonesia’s Gojek, which discontinued grocery shopping service GoMart two years ago, is also stepping up its efforts. A profitable future? To succeed in a market where many struggle with thin margins, players need to do more than just meet the surge in demand. They also have to find the right business model and managing costs. There are three common grocery delivery models in Southeast Asia. RedMart employs the warehouse model, where all the groceries are sourced and picked from one fulfillment center and then delivered via its in-house delivery fleet. Similarly, LazMart’s items are stored in Lazada’s fulfillment hubs. Grab is experimenting with a similar end-to-end model with GrabSupermartket in Malaysia. But GrabMart, the company’s main online grocery feature, is based on the concierge model, where the platform does not manage the inventory itself. Upon receiving the order, the platform transfers the details directly to its delivery personnel and professional shoppers who are responsible for shopping and delivering the items. GrabMart made its debut in late 2019 and expanded across the region early last year. The concierge model allows Grab to do on-demand delivery, providing users with more flexibility because they don’t have to preschedule their orders. A Grab spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that the company hopes to fill a gap in end-to-end grocery delivery, which relies heavily on prescheduling. “This model can be inflexible, impacting supermarkets’ ability to scale when demand for grocery delivery boomed during the lockdown,” he says. RedMart’s warehouse model offers pre-scheduled deliveries and a wider variety of products, which is critical in driving repeat usage among consumers. There’s also more room for cost savings, which could be passed down to consumers. “We have industry-leading levels of low food waste, achieved through accurate forecasting and replenishment, as well as significantly reduced handling of perishable foods, which happens at physical supermarkets,” said Richard Ruddy, chief retail officer and head of grocery at Lazada Singapore. The downside, however, is that sudden uptick in demand has temporarily paralyzed RedMart’s logistic networks. Last but not least is the community-oriented group buying model, where a platform gives out discounts to encourage bulk orders and depends on \"community leaders\" to help with user acquisition, sales, and marketing efforts. Like many online groceries, RedMart has yet to achieve profitability, but the warehouse model has proven to be sustainable outside of Singapore. For example, UK-based Ocado has a gross margin of around 33%. That’s lower than ecommerce firms generate, but it’s considered phenomenal in the sector. The British online supermarket was net profitable from 2014 to 2017. “While we can draw parallels from Ocado in similar aspects of the business, it is operating in a different market and is much more mature. It is a good benchmark to reference, but we are following our own timeline based on the market conditions in Singapore,” said Lazada’s Ruddy. For Grab, it’s unclear whether its fledgling online grocery arm is profitable compared to peers that have also adopted the concierge model. For example, US-based Instacart recorded its first monthly net profit in April 2020 after eight years in business. HappyFresh, which also operates under a concierge model, has seen profitable unit economics since 2017, according to CEO Guillem Segarra. He says that having other revenue streams apart from grocery delivery, such as advertisements and partnerships, is key. HappyFresh recorded a net profit in Indonesia in the first quarter of 2020. Covid-19 has provided fuel to propel ecommerce adoption in Southeast Asia, but can the momentum last? There seems to be a lot of optimism, with a recent study showing that the pandemic is giving online groceries a permanent bump. “We are seeing significant headway here, with our customers exhibiting cross-buying behavior in both the Lazada and RedMart marketplaces,\" notes Ruddy. Grab is also upbeat about its prospects, and it’s focused on bringing GrabMart to more areas in the region. “We will continue our expansion by growing our partner base, investing in technology and operations to ace grocery deliveries. Our goal is to bring GrabMart into all 394 cities that Grab is currently operating in,” the company spokesperson says.\n",

      "Singapore’s Honestbee to launch food delivery. It’ll get lots of competition Honestbee, a Singapore-based startup which started out as a grocery delivery service, now wants to send you lunch too. This move comes just a few months after it launched an on-demand laundry service. Announced via Facebook, the upcoming launch of meal deliveries, a feature which is currently being tested, puts Honestbee in a hyper-competitive space in Singapore filled with established players like UberEats, Deliveroo, and Foodpanda, as well as fledgling startups like Grain and DishDash. But that's just the start, an Honestbee spokesperson tells Tech in Asia. Its grand plan: to build a delivery network which enables freelance riders to fulfill an assortment of services. On the iOS app, users can now get health as well as home and auto products delivered to their doorsteps. These additional product categories are still undergoing early trials. Because it serves as a layer between services and consumers, it'll need to build up a huge volume of deliveries to make up for its thin margins. To that end, it has expanded its grocery service to eight countries in just 1.5 years. It's a trajectory the company has been on since \"day one,\" adds the spokesperson. Honestbee declined to reveal exact numbers about its performance, but says it has full-time 300 staff and \"12,500 registered delivery drivers and shoppers partners.\" Food deliveries could pair well with groceries, because in Singapore restaurants are often located near supermarkets in the same shopping malls. This move could increase the efficiency of its delivery network. Honestbee says that its food delivery service is \"not much different\" from competitors, but aims to stand out by offering consumers a wide range of conveniences beyond cooked food. Redmart, which got acquired by Lazada, is Honestbee's chief competitor in online groceries. Update on Feb 7, 5.30pm SGT: Added Honestbee's response.\n",

      "Ex-Honestbee, Foodpanda exec’s new cloud kitchen startup banks $1.2m in seed fundingMore than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, Taiwan's food and beverage industry continues to be pummeled as the island presses on in implementing measures to curb the virus' spread. However, a study from The Business Research Company expects the global F&B market to grow from almost US$2.8 trillion in 2020 - 47% of which came from the Asia Pacific - to about US$3.3 trillion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate of 18.5%. Victor Chow, a past executive at food delivery platforms Honestbee and Foodpanda, believes that this recovery can also be found in the clouds. With his new startup, 3 Square, Chow looks to help F&B operators by providing local businesses with cloud kitchen solutions, including digital food hall networks. Now, the company said it has secured US$1.2 million in an oversubscribed seed round from local department store chain Hanshin and foodtech VC firm Foodland Ventures to scale its business in Taiwan and enter more markets in Southeast Asia and North Asia. \"With Covid-19 leading to the closure of restaurants and bars, many restaurant owners are looking for an alternative to the traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant business model in order to cope with the significant shift in consumer demand from dine in to delivery,\" he said. 3 Square's first location can be found in the center of Taipei City, with twenty restaurant brands available for delivery, takeaway, and dine in. Popular restaurant partners include new brands from the Michelin-starred Mume Group and 30-year-old night market standout Shi Yuan Taiwanese Fried Chicken. The startup also has a virtual restaurant group with six in-house brands. According to the company, it's now preparing for its next round of funding to help fuel the expansion of 300 brands in the 3 Square ecosystem across the region.\n"
