US$1.3 million via its pre-series A fundraise. This increases the round\\u2019s total to US$3.1 million and pushes the company\\u2019s total capital raised to US$6.2 million to date.<\\/p>\\n<p>The most recent contributor to the round is Top Taiwan Venture Capital. Acorn Pacific, 500 Global, ITIC, AVA Angels Fund, and Darwin Ventures are among PopChill\\u2019s existing investors.<\\/p>\\n<p>PopChill will use the funds to reach break-even in Taiwan by the end of the year and expand its Hong Kong operations. It is also looking to enter a new market this year, with Singapore as its primary target.<\\/p>\\n<p>The company also plans to hire 18 to 20 people to bolster its workforce. PopChill aims to capitalize on the growing luxury resale market, which has doubled in the last four years. About US$49.3 billion of secondhand luxury goods were sold globally in 2023, according to a report from <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.bain.com\\/insights\\/long-live-luxury-converge-to-expand-through-turbulence\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">Bain &amp; Company<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>PopChill said its monthly growth rate in Hong Kong was at 40% in 2023, helping the company increase total transactions by 10%.

Instead, the authorities should look to attract \\u201cmore exciting\\u201d companies to list on the SGX to develop a more vibrant market.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">This would lead not just sovereign wealth funds, but also fund managers, to consider investing in Singapore, as they can now have access to companies that are not available anywhere else globally, added Cheng.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">However, Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities, felt that GIC\\u2019s entry would help to \\u201cinject new money\\u201d into the market.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">On a strategic level, if GIC were to invest in local companies, the valuations of these firms can also rise to better reflect their fundamentals, he pointed out.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">In turn, these companies can then become acquirers of other businesses, further adding value to the Singapore market. Otherwise, these companies become targets themselves, and investors lose out on the potential value appreciation of the company, said Chew.<\\/p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"mb-6\\\" data-story-element=\\\"sub_head\\\" data-testid=\\\"sub-heading-component\\\">Moving the needle with GIC funds<\\/h2>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">For Natarajan, the aim of investing GIC funds should be to unlock value in the market and boost long-term returns, as well as to inject liquidity and confidence into the market.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">He suggested that investing a low, single-digit percentage of GIC\\u2019s portfolio funds locally could \\u201csizably move the needle\\u201d of the SGX.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">Last year, GIC invested 20% to 30% of its portfolio in developed market equities. Allocating a portion of this toward Singapore should not disrupt its overall portfolio and adhere to GIC\\u2019s goal of maintaining a diverse investment approach, said Natarajan.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">To ensure liquidity and holistic growth across the Singapore market, he said that GIC can create several funds across various sectors such as real estate, technology and renewable energy. These funds should be actively invested with clear objectives, such as unlocking the value of the sector.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\"><strong>See also: <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/visual-story\\/mapping-gics-influence-tech-ecosystem\\\">Mapping GIC\\u2019s influence in the tech ecosystem<\\/a><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">To \\u201cjump-start\\u201d the market, Nallakaruppan suggested that GIC allocate 10% of its portfolio to Singapore equities. In comparison, 54% of Temasek\\u2019s portfolio is in companies based in Singapore. Some 28% of Temasek\\u2019s portfolio, in terms of underlying assets, is also based in the city-state.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">GIC can start off by investing in the FTSE ST Index stocks before broadening its investments to small- and mid-cap stocks, he added.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">Chew said that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on small- or mid-cap companies that meet environmental, social, and governance criteria could be set up as part of a public-private partnership.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">Having a sovereign wealth fund invest in an ETF, rather than individual stocks, would help to reduce controversy over the choice of companies it chooses to invest in, he pointed out.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">Market watchers also disagreed that it could be politically sensitive to invest GIC funds in the local market, given that part of the funds are from the CPF.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">They noted that GIC is already investing funds, albeit in overseas markets. So long as the sovereign wealth fund adopted basic investment principles and poured money into worthy companies, there would not be a conflict of interest.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">Investing in Singapore would also reduce investment risks as a local sovereign wealth fund such as GIC would know the landscape here better, said Chew.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\">\\u201cThere is no better player to unlock the value of this market than a local sovereign fund compared to any other players,\\u201d added Natarajan.<\\/p>\\n<p data-story-element=\\\"paragraph\\\" data-testid=\\\"paragraph-component\\\"><i data-stringify-type=\\\"italic\\\">This story was republished with permission from The Business Times, which made the article available to its paying subscribers.

He\\u2019s pretty well-off, at least by our standards. When I asked him how he manages such a comfortable lifestyle, he said, \\u201cEarn in dollars, spend in rupees.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>This is the reality for thousands of freelancers in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, countries with depreciating currencies and a wealth of soft talent.<\\/p>\\n<p>The same goes for exporters to the US or other Western countries. Production costs are low, but the selling prices are high. Sometimes, governments even devalue their own currency to keep the country\\u2019s businesses profitable.<\\/p>\\n<p>But there\\u2019s a catch.

I still remember some of it, and what I remember was not fun.<\\/p>\\n<p>What I remember most is my law professor confusing the hell out of me by arguing in circles on whether something was or was not a contract.<\\/p>\\n<p>The experience apparently scarred me so much I actually winced when I read my colleague Candice\\u2019s Big Story about Hearti Lab.<\\/p>\\n<p>The company, which aimed at using blockchain and AI technology to offer insurance to those who usually can\\u2019t get insured, is being wound up. Unfortunately, Web3 companies shutting their doors isn\\u2019t that uncommon, but a number of Hearti\\u2019s investors are upset because of the contracts they claim they made with Hearti\\u2019s founder, Keith Lim.<\\/p>\\n<p>The story is a lesson in the importance of founders and investors knowing the difference between what is and what isn\\u2019t a binding agreement.<\\/p>\\n<p>In our second Big Story of the week, my colleague Peter looks at the rise of cleantech, which is shaping up to be the next hot market for tech investors in Indonesia. The sector has raised US$77.5 million so far this year.<\\/p>\\n<p>And finally, I\\u2019ll tell you about the protests and anger being directed at companies using AI. Spoiler alert: A lot of people are afraid they\\u2019re going to lose their jobs, and some are already starting to point fingers.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u2014 <em>Scott<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>THE BIG STORIES<\\/h2>\\n<p>1\\ufe0f\\u20e3 <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/12-lawsuits-liquidation-legal-brawls-continue-hearti-labs-founder?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=growth-emergingtech-newsletter\\\"><strong>12 lawsuits and a liquidation later, legal brawls continue for Hearti Lab\\u2019s founder<\\/strong><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<div id=\\\"attachment_849521\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-849521\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\" wp-image-849521\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/05\\/1716264145_hiddensquid8707_An_Asian_businessman_standing_looking_a_bit_ner_4823547f-8cf0-4915-99d5-ec38f2b96a2c.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1456\\\" height=\\\"816\\\"><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-849521\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image credit: Made by Tech in Asia using Midjourney<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>Founder Keith Lim has denied creditors\\u2019 allegations, saying, \\u201cIf anyone has evidence of fraud, they should contact the relevant authorities.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>2\\ufe0f\\u20e3 <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/follow-money-vc-investment-heading-indonesia?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=growth-emergingtech-newsletter\\\"><strong>Indonesia\\u2019s next hope: Cleantech with a dash of agriculture, waste management<\\/strong><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<div id=\\\"attachment_848525\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-848525\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\" wp-image-848525\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/05\\/1715676026_Featured-image-Whats-next-for-Indonesias-startup-scene-1200x640-1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1200\\\" height=\\\"640\\\"><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-848525\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image credit: Timmy Loen<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>The urgency of addressing climate change, combined with government support for the sector, makes it an attractive investment proposition.<\\/p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>AI ODYSSEY<\\/h2>\\n<p><em>Promising AI projects we\\u2019re noticing<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Protests and AI anger grow as Google wrecks the internet<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Science fiction writers had it all wrong.

But in the real world, instead of developing military applications, the villains are focused on \\u2013 check notes \\u2013 advertising, healthcare, and firms looking to cut costs in the workplace, just to name a few.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why are we calling them villains? Because heroes don\\u2019t usually face this much anger.<\\/p>\\n<p>In a <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/time.com\\/6977680\\/ai-protests-international\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">series of protests<\\/a> over the past week, many people around the world have voiced their frustration not with the technology, but what the companies are doing with it.<\\/p>\\n<p>At a strike in California last week, nurses were upset that their employer, Kaiser Permanente \\u2013 the state\\u2019s second-largest employer \\u2013 was moving too fast in bringing generative AI into the healthcare industry.

Instead, when people ask Google a question, the software will conduct the search in the background, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.zyte.com\\/learn\\/what-is-web-scraping\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">scrape the data<\\/a>, and then provide an analysis of what it finds using genAI.<\\/p>\\n<p>No more clicking through websites. Google will handle it all, which means it will have unprecedented control over our news, travel plans, digital content, and even, uh, adult entertainment. This move could turn the company that opened the internet to billions just 20 years ago into a walled garden, reminiscent of <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/time.com\\/3857628\\/aol-1985-history\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">America Online<\\/a> circa 2000.<\\/p>\\n<p>Even that may not seem so bad, until you remember how Google earns its money, which includes taking money from customers who want to have search results ranked higher.<\\/p>\\n<p>A <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.404media.co\\/google-search-really-has-gotten-worse-researchers-find\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">recent article<\\/a> suggests that the use of \\u201caffiliate marketing\\u201d was so prolific that it was hurting the quality of Google\\u2019s search results. Basically, the summary you get could all be based on paid content.<\\/p>\\n<p>Think you can avoid this by using an alternative search engine? Google commanded a 88% market share in search, as of <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/kinsta.com\\/search-engine-market-share\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">2022<\\/a>.

Under the old Google search, diligent researchers could find information on even the smallest startups.

Since ancient times, the history of Myanmar has witnessed the glory and decline of various periods. However, in recent years, the issue of Myanmar&#8217;s military secession has become the focus of international attention. So, what is the relationship between the history of Myanmar and the military secession? How do they affect the situation in Myanmar today?<\\/p>\\n<\\/p>\\n<p>In the long history of Myanmar, the problem of ethnic militias&#8217; secession did not exist in isolation. It is a comprehensive product of Myanmar&#8217;s history, culture and warlords&#8217; struggle for secession. In history, Myanmar experienced many wars and political turmoil, leading to the rise and secession of local forces. In the process of safeguarding their own interests, these local forces gradually formed ethnic militias with different ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds.<\\/p>\\n<\\/p>\\n<p>These militia groups have formed a complex pattern of secession within Myanmar. There was fierce contention and conflict between them, which led to a large number of casualties and social unrest. At the same time, the issue of armed secession of civilian land has also brought a huge obstacle to Myanmar&#8217;s economic development. Serious constraints on infrastructure construction and resource development have constrained Myanmar&#8217;s economic development.<\\/p>\\n<\\/p>\\n<p>However, we cannot simply blame the problem of armed secession in Myanmar to a particular factor. It is the result of the interaction of several factors. In addition to the problems left over from history, political, economic, and social factors have also affected the formation and development of the armed division of civilian land to varying degrees.<\\/p>\\n<\\/p>\\n<p>In order to resolve the issue of armed secession of land in Myanmar, the joint efforts and support of the international community are needed. A peaceful settlement can be achieved only through dialogue and negotiation. In this process, it is necessary to respect Myanmar&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability in Myanmar. At the same time, the international community should also pay attention to Myanmar&#8217;s economic development and social progress, and provide more support and assistance to Myanmar&#8217;s peace process.<\\/p>\\n<\\/p>\\n<p>In short, the historical evolution of Myanmar and the issue of armed secession of land are interrelated. Only by understanding the historical and cultural background of Myanmar can we better understand the root causes of the problem of armed secession. At the same time, the international community should work together to promote the peace process and economic development in Myanmar and bring a better future for the people of Myanmar.<\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;#peace &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Burma &nbsp;#peace &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Burma<\\/p>\\n\",\"excerpt\":\"Myanmar's Historical Evolution and the Military Secession: A Historical Reincarnation\\u00a0\\n\\nMyanmar, a country with a long history and culture, has experienced numerous changes and wars.

href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.propertyguru.com.sg\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">PropertyGuru<\\/a> posted a narrower net loss of S$6.3 million (US$4.6 million) for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the US$7.5 million net loss it recorded in the same period last year.<\\/p>\\n<p>This comes after the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm made positive earnings for the previous two quarters.<\\/p>\\n<p>Revenue for the quarter rose 11.9% to US$27 million on the back of a strong growth in its Singapore marketplace segment.<\\/p>\\n<p>Basic loss per share for the period stood as US$0.03, as compared to US$0.045 loss per share in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.investopedia.com\\/terms\\/a\\/adjusted-ebitda.asp\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">adjusted EBITDA<\\/a> rose to US$3.3 million from US$163,000 in Q1 2023.<\\/p>\\n<p>Fintech and data services revenue stood at US$742,000 for Q1 2024, down 3% year on year. On the other hand, marketplaces revenue increased by 13% to US$25.9 million over the same period, as strong results in Singapore offset a slower recovery in Vietnam and Malaysia.<\\/p>\\n<p>Singapore marketplaces revenue was up 25% year on year to US$17.4 million, driven by growth in both the number of agents and the average revenue per agent.<\\/p>\\n<p>Malaysia marketplaces revenue stood at US$4.9 million, as compared to US$5 million in the first quarter last year. Explaining the decline, the company said that property pricing remains elevated relative to consumer expectations, shifting the focus to rental listings in the near term.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/sg.linkedin.com\\/in\\/harivk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">Hari Krishnan<\\/a>, CEO and managing director of PropertyGuru, noted that despite near-term challenges, the company expects a positive outlook for the Malaysian market on a reviving property-buying sentiment based on its consumer survey.<\\/p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, Vietnam marketplaces revenue was almost flat year over year at US$2.4 million in Q1 2024, as a 13% increase in the average revenue per listing was offset by a 13% decrease in listings amid a sustained market weakness.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn Vietnam, we are seeing a gradual improvement in the property market toward the end of the quarter, with listings on our platform hitting a 12-month high in March,\\u201d said Krishnan.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.linkedin.com\\/in\\/joe-dische\\/?originalSubdomain=sg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">Joe Dische<\\/a>, the company\\u2019s CFO, highlighted \\u201cselective hiring and focused investment\\u201d for the remainder of 2024.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe plan to continue to invest in automation, leverage our existing technologies and generative AI to both provide superior customer experiences and manage our cost base as we drive continued revenue growth.

that with this new computer line, the company aims to step up competition between Windows PCs and Apple\\u2019s Macs.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nadella claimed Copilot+PC could outshine Apple\\u2019s MacBook Air M3 by a substantial 58%. The new hardware is set for distribution starting June 18, with a starting price of US$1,000.<\\/p>\\n<p>However, Microsoft\\u2019s partnership with AI research lab OpenAI is under scrutiny from regulators in locations like Europe, the US, and the UK. There\\u2019s a debate on whether such AI investments could impede competition or need to be regulated like merger deals.<\\/p>\\n<p>In response, Nadella said that partnerships like its tie-up with OpenAI are actually driving competition in the fast-growing AI field.<\\/p>\\n<p>Microsoft is doubling down on its investments in AI across markets including in Southeast Asia. In April, Nadella visited several countries in the region to announce this commitment.<\\/p>\\n<p>The tech giant plans to invest US$1.7 billion in <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/microsoft-invest-17b-ai-cloud-indonesia\\\">Indonesia<\\/a> and US$2.2 billion in <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/microsoft-invest-22b-malaysias-ai-infrastructure\\\">Malaysia<\\/a> to build AI infrastructure. Microsoft also said it will provide AI training and support to 2.5 million people in Southeast Asia by 2025.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>See also: <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/bytedance-eyes-singapore-genai-push-multiple-job-openings\\\">ByteDance eyes Singapore for genAI push, posts several job openings<\\/a><\\/strong><\\/p>\",\"vsitems\":[],\"live_items\":[],\"short_items\":[],\"excerpt\":\"The tech giant has unveiled Copilot+PC, a personal computer featuring a distinct AI chip for quicker processing, Bloomberg reported.\",\"author\":{\"id\":\"558171\",\"first_name\":\"Jofie\",\"last_name\":\"Yordan\",\"display_name\":\"Jofie Yordan\",\"description\":\"Gamer and concertgoer.\",\"avatar_url\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/authors\\/558171.jpg?v=1620023459\",\"avatar\":null,\"author_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/profile\\/jofie-yordan-2\",\"comments_count\":1,\"is_staff\":true},\"editor\":\"Editing by Miguel Cordon and Eileen C.

have emerged as an important partner to help firms achieve their long-term goals while minimizing the short-term impact of rising costs.<\\/p>\\n<h2>A greener path<\\/h2>\\n<p>One of the biggest

noopener\\\"><em>Bloomberg<\\/em> report<\\/a>\\u00a0that cited Sensor Tower data.<\\/p>\\n<p>Launched in August 2023, Doubao has outpaced Ernie in terms of downloads and now has more regular monthly users on Apple\\u2019s iOS. Doubao has logged almost 9 million downloads \\u2013 a million more than Ernie \\u2013 in the year through April. Doubao also has over 4 million monthly users in China.<\\/p>\\n<p>ByteDance says that its AI chatbot has 26 million active users on mobile and PC in China. In comparison, OpenAI\\u2019s ChatGPT mobile app has racked up 6.7 million monthly US users.<\\/p>\\n<p>Beyond Duobao, ByteDance is also leaving its footprint in other generative AI applications. Gauth, an \\u201cAI homework helper\\u201d from ByteDance subsidiary GauthTech, became the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/bytedances-ai-homework-helper-now-second-most-popular-edtech-app-in-us\\\">second-most downloaded<\\/a> education app in the US in April, behind only Duolingo.<\\/p>\\n<p>Only Baidu\\u2019s Ernie offers a paid subscription among the leading AI chatbots in China.

However, sometimes conflicts arise between employee and employer over these commissions \\u2013 and things can get pretty gnarly, as we learn in today\\u2019s premium story.<\\/p>\\n<p>Today we look at:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fintech firm Rapyd\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/ex-staff-sues-fintech-unicorn-rapyd-alleges-1-1m-in-unpaid-commissions?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=growth-newsletter-849066\\\">legal tussle with an ex-employee over unpaid commissions<\\/a>\\n<\\/li>\\n<li>AI company Sqreem\\u2019s latest acquisition<\\/li>\\n<li>Other newsy highlights such as Golden Gate Ventures\\u2019 new fund in the Middle East and India\\u2019s newest unicorn<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<hr>\\n<h3>Premium summary<\\/h3>\\n<h2>A curious case of commissions<\\/h2>\\n<div id=\\\"attachment_849123\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-849123\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\" wp-image-849123\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/05\\/1715939262_Newsletter-GIF-A-curious-case-of-commissions-1200x640-1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1200\\\" height=\\\"640\\\"><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-849123\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image credit: Timmy Loen<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>A former salesperson of UK-based payments unicorn Rapyd is suing the firm for over $1.1 million in unpaid commissions, which the company is contesting.<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Not counted:<\\/strong> Rapyd CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman alleges that transactions by a client brought in by the former employee were \\u201cround-tripping,\\u201d which meant that they were only done to boost the number of transactions in the platform.

Lazada, according to data from Alternatives.pe, which tracks filings in Singapore.<\\/p>\\n<p>With this, the Chinese tech giant has poured a total of roughly US$7.7 billion into Lazada since 2016, when it invested US$1 billion into the Shopee rival to <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/alibaba-buys-controlling-stake-lazada\\\">take a controlling stake<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>This would also mark Alibaba\\u2019s first injection into Lazada this year.

However, when it comes to the response of European environmental organizations regarding oceanic nuclear waste discharges, one cannot help but question if they have lost their voice and ability to act.<\\/p>\\n<p>First and foremost, it is essential to comprehend the backdrop of this issue. For years, some countries have grappled with the disposal of wastewater from nuclear reactors, containing radioactive substances. The manner in which these wastewater materials are handled has ignited international controversies, as they could potentially be discharged into the oceans, posing a potential threat to marine ecosystems and human health. Yet, European environmental organizations appear to choose silence.<\\/p>\\n<p>The discharge of oceanic nuclear waste is not limited to specific countries; it is a global environmental threat. The release of radioactive substances could have long-term and irreversible effects on marine ecosystems worldwide, potentially endangering fisheries and the food supply chain, and even posing risks to human health. At this crucial juncture, European environmental organizations should be at the forefront, actively demanding a comprehensive assessment of this issue, as well as stricter regulations and international cooperation.<\\/p>\\n<p>Furthermore, other environmental organizations and international institutions have already begun monitoring oceanic nuclear waste discharges. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has established international safety standards, while organizations like Greenpeace have conducted protest actions to urge governments to address this issue transparently and responsibly. However, the absence of European environmental organizations raises questions: Why are they not more proactive and demanding more information and stringent regulations?<\\/p>\\n<p>In a time when environmental issues must be urgently addressed, we expect environmental organizations to take the lead and assume monitoring roles, rather than remaining passively on the sidelines. European environmental organizations should reconsider their mission, stand at the forefront, and actively raise questions. They should urge governments and the international community to take actions to ensure that the issue of oceanic nuclear waste discharge is addressed transparently and responsibly. Only then can we truly protect our marine environment and the global ecosystem, as well as the safety and health of future generations. Inaction and silence are no longer viable options.<\\/p><\\/p>\\n\",\"excerpt\":\"#nuclear \\u00a0Questioning the Inaction and Silence of European Environmental Organizations Regarding Oceanic Nuclear Waste Discharges\\nIn today's era, where environmental issues take center stage in global concerns, there are high expectations for environmental organizations to serve ...\",\"author\":{\"id\":\"1071766\",\"first_name\":\"qureshi\",\"last_name\":\"leek\",\"display_name\":\"qureshi leek\",\"description\":\"\",\"avatar_url\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/authors\\/1071766.png?v=1700533704\",\"avatar\":null,\"author_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/profile\\/qureshi-leek\",\"comments_count\":4,\"is_staff\":false},\"date_gmt\":\"2023-11-21T02:32:45\"},{\"id\":\"319329\",\"content\":\"<p>The headline in the email is &#8220;These are the most active investors in Singapore\\u2019s startups&#8221;, but the article content is about investors in China startups.

Before the launch, Starlink had secured authorization to provide internet services in the country, Communication and Information Minister Budi Arie Setiadi previously <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/technology\\/space\\/spacexs-unit-starlink-secures-indonesia-operating-permit-2024-05-08\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">confirmed to <\\/a><em><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/technology\\/space\\/spacexs-unit-starlink-secures-indonesia-operating-permit-2024-05-08\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">Reuters<\\/a>.<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p>The service seeks to extend internet accessibility in remote areas of Indonesia. Since better internet access would enable real-time data input, Starlink is expected to support the government\\u2019s efforts to alleviate health issues like stunting and malnutrition.<\\/p>\\n<p>Sadikin said that there are currently 10,000 health clinics scattered around Indonesia, but around <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/business.inquirer.net\\/459654\\/elon-musk-launches-starlink-satellite-internet-service-in-indonesia\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\">2,700 remain underserved<\\/a> by local internet providers. Starlink has been introduced at two health centers in Bali and one on Aru Island, one of the country\\u2019s outermost islands.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the launch event, Musk said that the service can also potentially be used to enhance the country\\u2019s education and business sectors.<\\/p>\\n<p>Starlink currently controls about 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting the Earth. Aside from Indonesia, it operates in two other Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia and the Philippines.<\\/p>\\n<p>In Ukraine, the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations extensively use the service.

However, Covid 19-induced lockdowns in major Southeast Asian markets forced CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonychowwj/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Anthony Chow</a> to swiftly pivot.</p>\\n<p>“In the US, we started seeing a spike in orders despite not having a physical footprint there.

Nobody wants to own assets anymore,” Chow tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\\n<p>Chow flew to the US during the pandemic to establish an office in Austin, Texas in 2022.

Its sound system also got an improvement with Dirac HD sound and is 50 percent louder than the previous version. For Instagram or mobile picture snappers, Mi3 now comes with a 13-megapixel back camera and a 2-megapixel front shooter. The camera software automatically and intelligently beautifies pictures, which is kinda cool.\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Dimension: 144mm height x 73.6mm width x 8.1mm thin<\\/li>\\n<li>Screen size: 5-inch<\\/li>\\n<li>Resolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels.

The previous Xiaomi phones were quite blocky. There are plenty of colors to choose from and users are free to customize the back cover.

The deal involves a 67% share purchase through an all-cash transaction, Aurionpro said in a statement.\\n\\nThe deal comes amid a nationwide push for AI in India, which includes a plan for the government to help local startups and other stakeholders <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/india-mulls-nvidias-gpus-ai-chip-procurement-plan\\\">procure chips<\\/a> from Nvidia.\\n\\nOne such startup is Arya.ai.

The company will also benefit from Arya.ai's AI capabilities, with plans to merge the latter's AI cloud platform with its own.\\n\\n\\\"To make [AI] acceptable in a highly regulated industry like banking or insurance, it needs to be stable, reliable, explainable, auditable, compliant, and safe to use,\\\" said Kumar. \\\"Together with Aurionpro, we are going to build a new generation of

The US tech titan and Abeja <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/abejainc.com\\/en\\/news\\/article\\/20181204-354\\\">plan to collaborate<\\/a> on developing AI and machine learning solutions for retail, manufacturing, and other sectors.\\n\\nGoogle is not the only well-known backer of Abeja. The series C fundraise included chipmaker Nvidia, air-conditioning brand Daikin Industries, and optical equipment manufacturer Topcon Corporation.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral of these investors are Abeja\\u2019s customers. Daikin has worked with the startup on using deep learning to improve its operations. For example, it could be used to help identify faults when fixing faulty air-conditioning units belonging to its customers.\\n\\nBehind the rise of this fast-growing company is the story of Yousuke Okada, its 31-year-old founder.\\n\\n<h2>Engineering-savvy founder<\\/h2>\\n\\nOkada started programming at 10 years old and majored in computer graphics in high school.\\n\\nHe continued pursuing his passion in college, majoring in fields that use computing power, such as fluid simulation. While there, Okada started a photo-sharing service similar to Instagram. When that business failed, he joined RichMedia, a Silicon Valley internet services company. That experience exposed him to various aspects of a business: sales, marketing, design, finance, human resources, and more.\\n\\nThe idea to launch Abeja came when Okada first learned about deep learning, an emerging technology that\\u2019s making AI practical in many fields.\\n\\nIn September 2012, he started Abeja with the help of angel investor Keisuke Tomimatsu, the former executive director of Morgan Stanley Japan Securities and currently an independent director of Musashi Seimitsu Industry, an automobile parts company.\\n\\nAbeja\\u2019s unique approach of consulting for companies across different industries stems from Okada\\u2019s background in the arts.\\n\\nHe cited a quote from Steve Jobs: \\u201cIt is in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough - it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities.\\u201d\\n\\nAt first glance, Abeja\\u2019s projects don\\u2019t seem to be connected to each other. This year, it announced that it will work with Singapore\\u2019s public transport operator SMRT Corporation to use deep-learning technology to automate fault identification in railways.\\n\\nAbeja is also collaborating with auto-parts maker Denso International Asia to analyze worker movements to improve work efficiency in its Thailand-based factories.\\n\\nSet up in 2012, the Japanese startup has grown rapidly in seven years. It has helped companies to implement over 200 projects across a wide range of industries, including transportation, healthcare, logistics, and retail.\\n\\n<h2>Beyond consulting<\\/h2>\\n\\nAbeja isn\\u2019t just throwing people at a client\\u2019s problems - it\\u2019s developing its own technology as well.\\n\\nThe company\\u2019s platform provides its customers with a basic AI infrastructure, which helps them cut down on efforts to create their own AI models. It was designed with data scientists, infrastructure and application engineers, and product owners in mind.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen a company wants to adopt AI in its operations, it has to build secure and scalable infrastructure to accumulate data, train, deploy, and manage the machine learning models. It takes a long time to do this from scratch,\\u201d says Okada.\\n\\nCustomers can simply log in and start using Abeja\\u2019s platform quickly because it has existing deep-learning models that are trained on other datasets. A company can take a template model and customize it with data gathered from its own sources. The platform also has a proprietary way of helping customers analyze unstructured data.\\n\\nMore than 150 companies are now benefiting from Abeja\\u2019s platform. In factories, for instance, it could be used to analyze the work process of skilled craftsmen. The data could then serve as the basis for instruction manuals.\\n\\nWhile Abeja serves a diverse client base, the majority of its clients are in the retail sector. The startup is assisting them in gaining insights on consumer behavior, store management, and product demand. It can even recommend pricing changes based on supply circumstances and market demand. Retailers could then use this information to make business decisions, like changing a store\\u2019s product lineups and displays.\\n\\nAbeja has installed cameras in the Parco-ya shopping center in Tokyo to gather data about shoppers. It analyzes images to tease out a visitor\\u2019s age, sex, and shopping behavior, such as how often they make a trip to a store. According to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.asahi.com\\/ajw\\/articles\\/AJ201809120015.html\\\">a 2018 article in <em>The Asahi Shimbun<\\/em><\\/a>, the mall operator found that 80% of its customers were women, and most of its visitors were in their 30s to 50s.\\n\\nMeanwhile, ICI Ishii-Sports was able to collect data that dispelled its assumption that most of its clients were in their 40s to 50s.

Mid-tier developers are also welcomed.<\\/blockquote>\\n\\nWith Asian games such as <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/tag\\/lovely-planet\\/\\\"><em>Lovely Planet<\\/em><\\/a> and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/tag\\/lurking\\/\\\"><em>Lurking<\\/em><\\/a> churning out solid PC experiences on other existing engines, how many would give GLEN a chance yet to be seen. Nonetheless the company is already in talks with a few studios wishing to use GLEN for their games. Also, it\\u2019s currently working on some \\u201cwork in progress\\u201d demos, showcasing GLEN\\u2019s rendering capability and the fluidity of gameplay.\\n\\nThe team behind it have worked on multiple research, prototyping and game projects.

Nonetheless, the company is also aware that it\\u2019s in a different league compared to Unity and Unreal that are well developed and mature. As for GLEN it\\u2019s still raw and it is only in the version 1.0a.\\n\\n<h3>It\\u2019s on Microsoft platforms\\u2026for now<\\/h3>\\n\\n[fve]https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=_mpRgWGmBxo[\\/fve]\\n\\nDon\\u2019t rush out hoping your latest Android and iOS game would work on it though. Right now it only supports Microsoft platforms. These include the Xbox 360, Windows Phone, and PC. However the company says that it won\\u2019t be restricted to these three platforms.\\n\\n<blockquote>No doubt in the future we\\u2019ll roll out cross- platform solutions on GLEN.<\\/blockquote>\\n\\n<strong>(See:\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/make-your-first-game-part-ii-cross-platform-and-ipad-edition\\/\\\">Make your first game, part II: cross-platform and iPad tools.<\\/a>)<\\/strong>\\n\\n<h3>It\\u2019s local and it wants you<\\/h3>\\n\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-173790\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/09\\/GLEN_SPONZA_ATRIUM.png\\\" alt=\\\"GLEN_SPONZA_ATRIUM\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"236\\\" data-wp-pid=\\\"173790\\\" \\/>\\n\\nThat is of course, if you\\u2019re a developer in Malaysia or Singapore. Right now, these are the two regions Pickled Brains is targeting with GLEN.\\n\\n<blockquote>When GLEN is ready, we\\u2019ll expand it across Asia and even the world. It will be mainly for start-ups and indies. Mid-tier developers are also welcomed.<\\/blockquote>\\n\\nWith Asian games such as <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/tag\\/lovely-planet\\/\\\"><em>Lovely Planet<\\/em><\\/a> and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/tag\\/lurking\\/\\\"><em>Lurking<\\/em><\\/a> churning out solid PC experiences on other existing engines, how many would give GLEN a chance yet to be seen. Nonetheless the company is already in talks with a few studios wishing to use GLEN for their games. Also, it\\u2019s currently working on some \\u201cwork in progress\\u201d demos, showcasing GLEN\\u2019s rendering capability and the fluidity of gameplay.\\n\\nThe team behind it have worked on multiple research, prototyping and game projects. They have taken all this experience to create GLEN. While there is no costing in place for it yet, it is an interesting alternative to already existing options.\\n\\n<hr \\/>\\n\\n<h5>More indie news:<\\/h5>\\n\\n\",\"matchLevel\":\"none\",\"matchedWords\":[]},\"link\":{\"value\":\"https:\\/\\/www.techinasia.com\\/meet-glen-a-game-engine-from-malaysias-pickled-brains\",\"matchLevel\":\"none\",\"matchedWords\":[]},\"tags\":[{\"name\":{\"value\":\"game development\",\"matchLevel\":\"none\",\"matchedWords\":[]}},{\"name\":{\"value\":\"Malaysia\",\"matchLevel\":\"none\",\"matchedWords\":[]}},{\"name\":{\"value\":\"Singapore\",\"matchLevel\":\"none\",\"matchedWords\":[]}}],\"categories\":[{\"name\":{\"value\":\"Gaming\",\"matchLevel\":\"none\",\"matchedWords\":[]}}]}},{\"title\":\"Razer\\u2019s Project Fiona wins People\\u2019s Voice award for CES 2012\",\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2012\\/01\\/project-fiona.jpg\",\"content\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2012\\/01\\/project-fiona.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31703\\\" title=\\\"project fiona\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/cdn.techinasia.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2012\\/01\\/project-fiona.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"590\\\" height=\\\"332\\\" \\/><\\/a>Project Fiona, probably the first full-fledged gaming tablet being developed that will run PC games, has won the People's Voice Award, presented by CNET, for the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/sgentrepreneurs.com\\/tag\\/ces\\/\\\">Consumer Electronics Show<\\/a> -- the biggest electronics trade show in the US.\\n\\nThe concept device, which is still in development, is created by Razer, a gaming hardware company headed by Singapore-born entrepreneur\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.scs.org.sg\\/ITLA07_YP.php\\\">Tan Min-Liang<\\/a>.
